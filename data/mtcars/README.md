# mtcars

This is a toy dataset often used for basic data analysis practice. For this example, I used a copy that was available from a public github repo `vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets`. It contains information about 32 models of motor cars. The variables are:

- mpg: Miles per gallon
- cyl: Number of cylinders
- disp: Displacement (cu.in.)
- hp: Gross horsepower
- drat: Rear axle ratio
- wt: Weight (1000 lbs)
- qsec: 1/4 mile time
- vs: Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)
- am: Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
- gear: Number of forward gears
- carb: Number of carburetors

The data set is available in the `mtcars` tibble in `mtcars.rds`.
