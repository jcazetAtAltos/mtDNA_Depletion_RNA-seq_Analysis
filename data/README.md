# Data

This is the data directory. It will include the scripts used to process data needed by the analyses in `analyses/`. Processed data that is small (< 50MB) can be included in the repository. Larger data files should be stored in a separate repository and linked to in the scripts that process the data. Each dataset should be processed and included in its own subfolder. The subfolder should contain a `README.md` file that describes the data and the processing steps to ensure reproducibility.
