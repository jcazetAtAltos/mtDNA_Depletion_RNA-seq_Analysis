# Differential gene expression analysis of a transcriptomic timecourse of mtDNA depletion

This repository contains the results an analysis aimed at identifying transcriptomic changes during a 10 day mtDNA depletion and recovery timecourse. This work uses RNA-seq data generated by Shivaani Krishna while she was at UC Davis.

The analysis is broken into four sections (organized as subfolders within the `analyses` folder): `mapping`, which describes the approach used for processing and mapping the raw RNA-seq reads; `DGE`, which describes the process of identifying differentially expressed genes; `clusteringAnalysis`, which describes the process of clustering genes based on their expression dynamics during the timecourse and performing pathway enrichment analyses; and `GOI`, which describes generating individual gene plots and heatmaps for genes or gene sets of interest.
