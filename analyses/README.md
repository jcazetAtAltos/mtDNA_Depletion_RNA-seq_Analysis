# Analyses

This folder contains the data analyses performed as part of the project in this repo. The analyses are organized into subfolders, each of which contains the analysis code and results.

Each analysis folder should be self-contained and "atomic," meaning that each analysis should be focused and specific. Ideally, each analysis will address only a few core questions about the data "e.g., what are the differentially-expressed genes that change with aging? What pathways do they relate to?" 

Each analysis folder should contain a `README.md` file that describes the analysis and the results. All data needed to reproduce the analysis should be available from this repository. If the analysis requires data that is too large to include in the repository, the data should be stored in a separate repository and linked to in the analysis code and described in the `README.md` file.
