# Analyses

This folder contains the data analyses performed as part of the project in this repo. The analyses are organized into subfolders, each of which contains the analysis code and results.

The analyses contained in the `DGE`, `clusteringAnalyses`, and `GOI` were performed entirely in R. The source code is provided as a R markdown documents, which have also been rendered as HTML files for reading convenience. 

The analysis described in the `mapping` folder was performed using shell scripts, and is not associated with an R markdown document. All scripts that were used for the analysis are provided within the `mapping` directory, and a description of the processing pipeline is provided in the `mapping` README.
