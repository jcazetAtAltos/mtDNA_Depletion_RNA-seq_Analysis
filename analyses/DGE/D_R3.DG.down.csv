Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Required for maximal ATPase activity of SMARCA4/BRG1/BAF190A and for association of the SMARCA4/BRG1/BAF190A containing remodeling complex BAF with chromatin/nuclear matrix. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and is required for the proliferation of neural progenitors. During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity). Component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex which is involved in transcriptional activation of select genes principally by acetylation of nucleosomal histones H4 and H2A. This modification may both alter nucleosome - DNA interactions and promote interaction of the modified histones with other proteins which positively regulate transcription. This complex may be required for the activation of transcriptional programs associated with oncogene and proto-oncogene mediated growth induction, tumor suppressor mediated growth arrest and replicative senescence, apoptosis, and DNA repair. NuA4 may also play a direct role in DNA repair when recruited to sites of DNA damage. Putative core component of the chromatin remodeling INO80 complex which is involved in transcriptional regulation, DNA replication and probably DNA repair. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z2N8, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14966270, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29374058, ECO:0000303|PubMed:15196461, ECO:0000303|PubMed:22952240, ECO:0000303|PubMed:26601204}.","ACTL6A","brahma complex [GO:0035060]; chromatin [GO:0000785]; GBAF complex [GO:0140288]; Ino80 complex [GO:0031011]; kinetochore [GO:0000776]; npBAF complex [GO:0071564]; NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex [GO:0035267]; nuclear matrix [GO:0016363]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleosome [GO:0000786]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; protein-containing complex [GO:0032991]; RSC-type complex [GO:0016586]; SWI/SNF complex [GO:0016514]; chromatin binding [GO:0003682]; transcription coactivator activity [GO:0003713]; blastocyst formation [GO:0001825]; chromatin remodeling [GO:0006338]; DNA recombination [GO:0006310]; DNA repair [GO:0006281]; histone acetylation [GO:0016573]; histone exchange [GO:0043486]; histone H2A acetylation [GO:0043968]; histone H4 acetylation [GO:0043967]; negative regulation of cell differentiation [GO:0045596]; nervous system development [GO:0007399]; neural retina development [GO:0003407]; positive regulation of cell differentiation [GO:0045597]; positive regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0008284]; positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription [GO:0045893]; positive regulation of double-strand break repair [GO:2000781]; positive regulation of double-strand break repair via homologous recombination [GO:1905168]; positive regulation of myoblast differentiation [GO:0045663]; positive regulation of stem cell population maintenance [GO:1902459]; positive regulation of T cell differentiation [GO:0045582]; positive regulation of telomere maintenance in response to DNA damage [GO:1904507]; regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0042981]; regulation of cell cycle [GO:0051726]; regulation of chromosome organization [GO:0033044]; regulation of DNA replication [GO:0006275]; regulation of DNA strand elongation [GO:0060382]; regulation of DNA-templated transcription [GO:0006355]; regulation of double-strand break repair [GO:2000779]; regulation of embryonic development [GO:0045995]; regulation of G0 to G1 transition [GO:0070316]; regulation of G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle [GO:2000045]; regulation of mitotic metaphase/anaphase transition [GO:0030071]; regulation of nucleotide-excision repair [GO:2000819]; regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0006357]; signal transduction [GO:0007165]; spinal cord development [GO:0021510]; telomere maintenance [GO:0000723]","P25490","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18026119}.","ENST00000392662.5 [O96019-2];ENST00000429709.7 [O96019-1];ENST00000450518.6 [O96019-2];",0.00174663446278493

Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis (PubMed:16581796). AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules (By similarity). AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway (PubMed:19033387). During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (PubMed:23676497). The AP-2 mu subunit binds to transmembrane cargo proteins; it recognizes the Y-X-X-Phi motifs (By similarity). The surface region interacting with to the Y-X-X-Phi motif is inaccessible in cytosolic AP-2, but becomes accessible through a conformational change following phosphorylation of AP-2 mu subunit at Thr-156 in membrane-associated AP-2 (PubMed:11877457). The membrane-specific phosphorylation event appears to involve assembled clathrin which activates the AP-2 mu kinase AAK1 (PubMed:11877457).

The CPC complex has essential functions at the centromere in ensuring correct chromosome alignment and segregation and is required for chromatin-induced microtubule stabilization and spindle assembly (PubMed:11516652, PubMed:12925766, PubMed:14610074, PubMed:14722118, PubMed:26829474). Involved in the bipolar attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores and is a key regulator for the onset of cytokinesis during mitosis (PubMed:15249581). Required for central/midzone spindle assembly and cleavage furrow formation (PubMed:12458200, PubMed:12686604). Key component of the cytokinesis checkpoint, a process required to delay abscission to prevent both premature resolution of intercellular chromosome bridges and accumulation of DNA damage: phosphorylates CHMP4C, leading to retain abscission-competent VPS4 (VPS4A and/or VPS4B) at the midbody ring until abscission checkpoint signaling is terminated at late cytokinesis (PubMed:22422861, PubMed:24814515). AURKB phosphorylates the CPC complex subunits BIRC5/survivin, CDCA8/borealin and INCENP (PubMed:11516652, PubMed:12925766, PubMed:14610074). Phosphorylation of INCENP leads to increased AURKB activity (PubMed:11516652, PubMed:12925766, PubMed:14610074). Other known AURKB substrates involved in centromeric functions and mitosis are CENPA, DES/desmin, GPAF, KIF2C, NSUN2, RACGAP1, SEPTIN1, VIM/vimentin, HASPIN, and histone H3 (PubMed:11784863, PubMed:12689593, PubMed:14602875, PubMed:11856369, PubMed:16103226, PubMed:21658950, PubMed:11756469). A positive feedback loop involving HASPIN and AURKB contributes to localization of CPC to centromeres (PubMed:21658950). Phosphorylation of VIM controls vimentin filament segregation in cytokinetic process, whereas histone H3 is phosphorylated at 'Ser-10' and 'Ser-28' during mitosis (H3S10ph and H3S28ph, respectively) (PubMed:11784863, PubMed:11856369). A positive feedback between HASPIN and AURKB contributes to CPC localization (PubMed:21658950). AURKB is also required for kinetochore localization of BUB1 and SGO1 (PubMed:15020684, PubMed:17617734). Phosphorylation of p53/TP53 negatively regulates its transcriptional activity (PubMed:20959462). Key regulator of active promoters in resting B- and T-lymphocytes: acts by mediating phosphorylation of H3S28ph at active promoters in resting B-cells, inhibiting RNF2/RING1B-mediated ubiquitination of histone H2A and enhancing binding and activity of the USP16 deubiquitinase at transcribed genes (By similarity). Acts as an inhibitor of CGAS during mitosis: catalyzes phosphorylation of the N-terminus of CGAS during the G2-M transition, blocking CGAS liquid phase separation and activation, and thereby preventing CGAS-induced autoimmunity (PubMed:33542149). Phosphorylates KRT5 during anaphase and telophase (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O70126, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11516652, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11756469, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11784863, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11856369, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12458200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12686604, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12689593, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12925766, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14602875, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14610074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14722118, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15020684, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15249581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16103226, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17617734, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21658950, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22422861, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24814515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26829474, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33542149}.","AURKB","chromocenter [GO:0010369]; chromosome passenger complex [GO:0032133]; condensed chromosome, centromeric region [GO:0000779]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; kinetochore [GO:0000776]; microtubule cytoskeleton [GO:0015630]; midbody [GO:0030496]; mitotic spindle midzone [GO:1990023]; mitotic spindle pole [GO:0097431]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; spindle [GO:0005819]; spindle microtubule [GO:0005876]; spindle midzone [GO:0051233]; spindle pole centrosome [GO:0031616]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; histone serine kinase activity [GO:0035174]; kinase binding [GO:0019900]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004712]; abscission [GO:0009838]; aging [GO:0007568]; attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochore [GO:0008608]; cell population proliferation [GO:0008283]; cellular response to UV [GO:0034644]; cleavage furrow formation [GO:0036089]; histone modification [GO:0016570]; mitotic cell cycle [GO:0000278]; mitotic cytokinesis [GO:0000281]; mitotic cytokinesis checkpoint signaling [GO:0044878]; mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint signaling [GO:0007094]; mitotic spindle midzone assembly [GO:0051256]; mitotic spindle organization [GO:0007052]; negative regulation of B cell apoptotic process [GO:0002903]; negative regulation of cytokinesis [GO:0032466]; negative regulation of protein binding [GO:0032091]; negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0000122]; positive regulation of attachment of mitotic spindle microtubules to kinetochore [GO:1902425]; positive regulation of cytokinesis [GO:0032467]; positive regulation of lateral attachment of mitotic spindle microtubules to kinetochore [GO:1905116]; positive regulation of mitotic cell cycle spindle assembly checkpoint [GO:0090267]; positive regulation of mitotic cytokinesis [GO:1903490]; positive regulation of mitotic sister chromatid segregation [GO:0062033]; positive regulation of mitotic sister chromatid separation [GO:1901970]; positive regulation of protein phosphorylation [GO:0001934]; positive regulation of telomerase activity [GO:0051973]; positive regulation of telomere capping [GO:1904355]; positive regulation of telomere maintenance via telomerase [GO:0032212]; post-translational protein modification [GO:0043687]; protein autophosphorylation [GO:0046777]; protein localization to kinetochore [GO:0034501]; protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]; regulation of chromosome segregation [GO:0051983]; regulation of cytokinesis [GO:0032465]; regulation of signal transduction by p53 class mediator [GO:1901796]; spindle organization [GO:0007051]","O15392; O15392-1; O15392-2; Q16543; Q53HL2; Q86XJ1; Q16695; P08238; Q9NQS7; Q9NQS7-1; Q92993; Q15691; P06748; P30153; Q8WYJ6; O75410-6; Q99986","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462}.

Initiates the canonical BMP signaling cascade by associating with type I receptor BMPR1A and type II receptor BMPR2 (PubMed:25868050, PubMed:8006002). Once all three components are bound together in a complex at the cell surface, BMPR2 phosphorylates and activates BMPR1A. In turn, BMPR1A propagates signal by phosphorylating SMAD1/5/8 that travel to the nucleus and act as activators and repressors of transcription of target genes (PubMed:25868050, PubMed:29212066). Can also signal through non-canonical BMP pathways such as ERK/MAP kinase, PI3K/Akt, or SRC cascades (PubMed:31363885).

Required for the kinetochore localization of PLK1. Required for centromeric enrichment of AUKRB in prometaphase. Plays an important role in defining SGO1 localization and thereby affects sister chromatid cohesion. Acts as a substrate for anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) in complex with its activator CDH1 (APC/C-Cdh1). Necessary for ensuring proper chromosome segregation and binding to BUB3 is essential for this function. Can regulate chromosome segregation in a kinetochore-independent manner. Can phosphorylate BUB3. The BUB1-BUB3 complex plays a role in the inhibition of APC/C when spindle-assembly checkpoint is activated and inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of APC/C by phosphorylating its activator CDC20. This complex can also phosphorylate MAD1L1.

Phosphorylates CTNNB1, USP37, p53/TP53, NPM1, CDK7, RB1, BRCA2, MYC, NPAT, EZH2. Triggers duplication of centrosomes and DNA. Acts at the G1-S transition to promote the E2F transcriptional program and the initiation of DNA synthesis, and modulates G2 progression; controls the timing of entry into mitosis/meiosis by controlling the subsequent activation of cyclin B/CDK1 by phosphorylation, and coordinates the activation of cyclin B/CDK1 at the centrosome and in the nucleus. Crucial role in orchestrating a fine balance between cellular proliferation, cell death, and DNA repair in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Activity of CDK2 is maximal during S phase and G2; activated by interaction with cyclin E during the early stages of DNA synthesis to permit G1-S transition, and subsequently activated by cyclin A2 (cyclin A1 in germ cells) during the late stages of DNA replication to drive the transition from S phase to mitosis, the G2 phase. EZH2 phosphorylation promotes H3K27me3 maintenance and epigenetic gene silencing. Phosphorylates CABLES1 (By similarity). Cyclin E/CDK2 prevents oxidative stress-mediated Ras-induced senescence by phosphorylating MYC. Involved in G1-S phase DNA damage checkpoint that prevents cells with damaged DNA from initiating mitosis; regulates homologous recombination-dependent repair by phosphorylating BRCA2, this phosphorylation is low in S phase when recombination is active, but increases as cells progress towards mitosis. In response to DNA damage, double-strand break repair by homologous recombination a reduction of CDK2-mediated BRCA2 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of RB1 disturbs its interaction with E2F1. NPM1 phosphorylation by cyclin E/CDK2 promotes its dissociates from unduplicated centrosomes, thus initiating centrosome duplication. Cyclin E/CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of NPAT at G1-S transition and until prophase stimulates the NPAT-mediated activation of histone gene transcription during S phase. Required for vitamin D-mediated growth inhibition by being itself inactivated. Involved in the nitric oxide- (NO) mediated signaling in a nitrosylation/activation-dependent manner. USP37 is activated by phosphorylation and thus triggers G1-S transition. CTNNB1 phosphorylation regulates insulin internalization. Phosphorylates FOXP3 and negatively regulates its transcriptional activity and protein stability (By similarity). Phosphorylates CDK2AP2 (PubMed:12944431).

Drives chromosome congression (alignment of chromosomes at the spindle equator resulting in the formation of the metaphase plate) by mediating the lateral sliding of polar chromosomes along spindle microtubules towards the spindle equator and by aiding the establishment and maintenance of connections between kinetochores and spindle microtubules (PubMed:7889940, PubMed:23891108, PubMed:25395579). The transport of pole-proximal chromosomes towards the spindle equator is favored by microtubule tracks that are detyrosinated (PubMed:25908662). Acts as a processive bi-directional tracker of dynamic microtubule tips; after chromosomes have congressed, continues to play an active role at kinetochores, enhancing their links with dynamic microtubule ends (PubMed:23955301). Suppresses chromosome congression in NDC80-depleted cells and contributes positively to congression only when microtubules are stabilized (PubMed:25743205). Plays an important role in the formation of stable attachments between kinetochores and spindle microtubules (PubMed:17535814) The stabilization of kinetochore-microtubule attachment also requires CENPE-dependent localization of other proteins to the kinetochore including BUB1B, MAD1 and MAD2. Plays a role in spindle assembly checkpoint activation (SAC) via its interaction with BUB1B resulting in the activation of its kinase activity, which is important for activating SAC.

Binds IGF1 with high affinity and IGF2 and insulin (INS) with a lower affinity. The activated IGF1R is involved in cell growth and survival control. IGF1R is crucial for tumor transformation and survival of malignant cell. Ligand binding activates the receptor kinase, leading to receptor autophosphorylation, and tyrosines phosphorylation of multiple substrates, that function as signaling adapter proteins including, the insulin-receptor substrates (IRS1/2), Shc and 14-3-3 proteins. Phosphorylation of IRSs proteins lead to the activation of two main signaling pathways: the PI3K-AKT/PKB pathway and the Ras-MAPK pathway. The result of activating the MAPK pathway is increased cellular proliferation, whereas activating the PI3K pathway inhibits apoptosis and stimulates protein synthesis. Phosphorylated IRS1 can activate the 85 kDa regulatory subunit of PI3K (PIK3R1), leading to activation of several downstream substrates, including protein AKT/PKB. AKT phosphorylation, in turn, enhances protein synthesis through mTOR activation and triggers the antiapoptotic effects of IGFIR through phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD. In parallel to PI3K-driven signaling, recruitment of Grb2/SOS by phosphorylated IRS1 or Shc leads to recruitment of Ras and activation of the ras-MAPK pathway. In addition to these two main signaling pathways IGF1R signals also through the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway (JAK/STAT). Phosphorylation of JAK proteins can lead to phosphorylation/activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins. In particular activation of STAT3, may be essential for the transforming activity of IGF1R. The JAK/STAT pathway activates gene transcription and may be responsible for the transforming activity. JNK kinases can also be activated by the IGF1R. IGF1 exerts inhibiting activities on JNK activation via phosphorylation and inhibition of MAP3K5/ASK1, which is able to directly associate with the IGF1R.; FUNCTION: When present in a hybrid receptor with INSR, binds IGF1. PubMed:12138094 shows that hybrid receptors composed of IGF1R and INSR isoform Long are activated with a high affinity by IGF1, with low affinity by IGF2 and not significantly activated by insulin, and that hybrid receptors composed of IGF1R and INSR isoform Short are activated by IGF1, IGF2 and insulin. In contrast, PubMed:16831875 shows that hybrid receptors composed of IGF1R and INSR isoform Long and hybrid receptors composed of IGF1R and INSR isoform Short have similar binding characteristics, both bind IGF1 and have a low affinity for insulin.","IGF1R","alphav-beta3 integrin-IGF-1-IGF1R complex [GO:0035867]; axon [GO:0030424]; caveola [GO:0005901]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; insulin receptor complex [GO:0005899]; integral component of plasma membrane [GO:0005887]; intracellular membrane-bounded organelle [GO:0043231]; membrane [GO:0016020]; neuronal cell body [GO:0043025]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; protein kinase complex [GO:1902911]; receptor complex [GO:0043235]; T-tubule [GO:0030315]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; G-protein alpha-subunit binding [GO:0001965]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; insulin binding [GO:0043559]; insulin receptor activity [GO:0005009]; insulin receptor binding [GO:0005158]; insulin receptor substrate binding [GO:0043560]; insulin-like growth factor binding [GO:0005520]; insulin-like growth factor I binding [GO:0031994]; insulin-like growth factor receptor activity [GO:0005010]; phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase binding [GO:0043548]; protein transporter activity [GO:0140318]; protein tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004713]; structural molecule activity [GO:0005198]; transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004714]; aging [GO:0007568]; amyloid-beta clearance [GO:0097242]; axonogenesis [GO:0007409]; cardiac atrium development [GO:0003230]; cellular response to aldosterone [GO:1904045]; cellular response to amyloid-beta [GO:1904646]; cellular response to angiotensin [GO:1904385]; cellular response to dexamethasone stimulus [GO:0071549]; cellular response to estradiol stimulus [GO:0071392]; cellular response to glucose stimulus [GO:0071333]; cellular response to insulin-like growth factor stimulus [GO:1990314]; cellular response to mechanical stimulus [GO:0071260]; cellular response to progesterone stimulus [GO:0071393]; cellular response to testosterone stimulus [GO:0071394]; cellular response to transforming growth factor beta stimulus [GO:0071560]; cellular response to zinc ion starvation [GO:0034224]; cellular senescence [GO:0090398]; cerebellum development [GO:0021549]; dendritic spine maintenance [GO:0097062]; establishment of cell polarity [GO:0030010]; estrous cycle [GO:0044849]; glucose homeostasis [GO:0042593]; hippocampus development [GO:0021766]; immune response [GO:0006955]; insulin receptor signaling pathway [GO:0008286]; insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway [GO:0048009]; negative regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043066]; negative regulation of cholangiocyte apoptotic process [GO:1904193]; negative regulation of hepatocyte apoptotic process [GO:1903944]; negative regulation of MAPK cascade [GO:0043409]; negative regulation of muscle cell apoptotic process [GO:0010656]; peptidyl-tyrosine autophosphorylation [GO:0038083]; phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling [GO:0014065]; phosphatidylinositol-mediated signaling [GO:0048015]; positive regulation of axon regeneration [GO:0048680]; positive regulation of cell migration [GO:0030335]; positive regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0008284]; positive regulation of cold-induced thermogenesis [GO:0120162]; positive regulation of cytokinesis [GO:0032467]; positive regulation of DNA metabolic process [GO:0051054]; positive regulation of kinase activity [GO:0033674]; positive regulation of MAPK cascade [GO:0043410]; positive regulation of osteoblast proliferation [GO:0033690]; positive regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling [GO:0014068]; positive regulation of protein kinase B signaling [GO:0051897]; positive regulation of protein-containing complex disassembly [GO:0043243]; positive regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation [GO:0048661]; positive regulation of steroid hormone biosynthetic process [GO:0090031]; protein autophosphorylation [GO:0046777]; regulation of JNK cascade [GO:0046328]; response to ethanol [GO:0045471]; response to L-glutamate [GO:1902065]; response to nicotine [GO:0035094]; response to vitamin E [GO:0033197]; signal transduction [GO:0007165]; transcytosis [GO:0045056]; transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway [GO:0007169]","Q9NZN5; PRO_0000004724 [P49913]; P41240; P35222; P05019; P08069; P06213; P05556; Q9Y2W7; Q9UJU2; P27986; O00459; P35813; P18031; Q06124; P29350; P29353-2; Q01995; Q64010; P01317","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17524361}; Single-pass type I membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17524361}.","ENST00000650285.1;",0.000129492613939689

Upon binding to R-spondins (RSPO1, RSPO2, RSPO3 or RSPO4), associates with phosphorylated LRP6 and frizzled receptors that are activated by extracellular Wnt receptors, triggering the canonical Wnt signaling pathway to increase expression of target genes. In contrast to classical G-protein coupled receptors, does not activate heterotrimeric G-proteins to transduce the signal. Its function as activator of the Wnt signaling pathway is required for the development of various organs, including liver, kidney, intestine, bone, reproductive tract and eye. May also act as a receptor for norrin (NDP), such results however require additional confirmation in vivo. Required during spermatogenesis to activate the Wnt signaling pathway in peritubular myoid cells. Required for the maintenance of intestinal stem cells and Paneth cell differentiation in postnatal intestinal crypts. Acts as a regulator of bone formation and remodeling. Involved in kidney development; required for maintaining the ureteric bud in an undifferentiated state. Involved in the development of the anterior segment of the eye. Required during erythropoiesis. Also acts as a negative regulator of innate immunity by inhibiting TLR2/TLR4 associated pattern-recognition and pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

With MAP3K3/MKK3, catalyzes the concomitant phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in the MAP kinases p38 MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and MAPK14 and plays an important role in the regulation of cellular responses to cytokines and all kinds of stresses. Especially, MAP2K3/MKK3 and MAP2K6/MKK6 are both essential for the activation of MAPK11 and MAPK13 induced by environmental stress, whereas MAP2K6/MKK6 is the major MAPK11 activator in response to TNF. MAP2K6/MKK6 also phosphorylates and activates PAK6. The p38 MAP kinase signal transduction pathway leads to direct activation of transcription factors. Nuclear targets of p38 MAP kinase include the transcription factors ATF2 and ELK1. Within the p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway, MAP3K6/MKK6 mediates phosphorylation of STAT4 through MAPK14 activation, and is therefore required for STAT4 activation and STAT4-regulated gene expression in response to IL-12 stimulation. The pathway is also crucial for IL-6-induced SOCS3 expression and down-regulation of IL-6-mediated gene induction; and for IFNG-dependent gene transcription. Has a role in osteoclast differentiation through NF-kappa-B transactivation by TNFSF11, and in endochondral ossification and since SOX9 is another likely downstream target of the p38 MAPK pathway. MAP2K6/MKK6 mediates apoptotic cell death in thymocytes. Acts also as a regulator for melanocytes dendricity, through the modulation of Rho family GTPases. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10961885, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11727828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15550393, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20869211, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8622669, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8626699, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8663074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9218798}.","MAP2K6","cytoskeleton [GO:0005856]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; MAP kinase kinase activity [GO:0004708]; phosphatase activator activity [GO:0019211]; protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity [GO:0043539]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004713]; apoptotic process [GO:0006915]; bone development [GO:0060348]; cardiac muscle contraction [GO:0060048]; cellular response to sorbitol [GO:0072709]; cellular senescence [GO:0090398]; DNA damage induced protein phosphorylation [GO:0006975]; MAPK cascade [GO:0000165]; negative regulation of cold-induced thermogenesis [GO:0120163]; nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing signaling pathway [GO:0070423]; osteoblast differentiation [GO:0001649]; ovulation cycle process [GO:0022602]; p38MAPK cascade [GO:0038066]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of MAP kinase activity [GO:0043406]; positive regulation of nitric-oxide synthase biosynthetic process [GO:0051770]; positive regulation of prostaglandin secretion [GO:0032308]; regulation of cell cycle [GO:0051726]; regulation of signal transduction by p53 class mediator [GO:1901796]; response to ischemia [GO:0002931]; response to xenobiotic stimulus [GO:0009410]; signal transduction [GO:0007165]; stress-activated MAPK cascade [GO:0051403]","Q5S007; Q16539; Q16236; Q9NRD5; O76024; P52564-1","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9768359}.

Mediates glutamate, aspartate or serine ADP-ribosylation of proteins: the ADP-D-ribosyl group of NAD(+) is transferred to the acceptor carboxyl group of target residues and further ADP-ribosyl groups are transferred to the 2'-position of the terminal adenosine moiety, building up a polymer with an average chain length of 20-30 units (PubMed:25043379, PubMed:30104678, PubMed:30321391). Serine ADP-ribosylation of proteins constitutes the primary form of ADP-ribosylation of proteins in response to DNA damage (PubMed:32939087). Mediates glutamate and aspartate ADP-ribosylation of target proteins in absence of HPF1 (PubMed:25043379). Following interaction with HPF1, catalyzes serine ADP-ribosylation of target proteins; HPF1 conferring serine specificity by completing the PARP2 active site (PubMed:28190768, PubMed:32028527, PubMed:34486521, PubMed:34874266, PubMed:34108479). PARP2 initiates the repair of double-strand DNA breaks: recognizes and binds DNA breaks within chromatin and recruits HPF1, licensing serine ADP-ribosylation of target proteins, such as histones, thereby promoting decompaction of chromatin and the recruitment of repair factors leading to the reparation of DNA strand breaks (PubMed:10364231, PubMed:32939087, PubMed:34108479). HPF1 initiates serine ADP-ribosylation but restricts the polymerase activity of PARP2 in order to limit the length of poly-ADP-ribose chains (PubMed:34732825, PubMed:34795260). Specifically mediates formation of branched poly-ADP-ribosylation (PubMed:30104678). Branched poly-ADP-ribose chains are specifically recognized by some factors, such as APLF (PubMed:30104678).

The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 or ARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1, NR1D2, RORA, RORB and RORG, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1 transcription, respectively. Has a redundant role with the other PER proteins PER1 and PER2 and is not essential for the circadian rhythms maintenance. In contrast, plays an important role in sleep-wake timing and sleep homeostasis probably through the transcriptional regulation of sleep homeostasis-related genes, without influencing circadian parameters. Can bind heme. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17346965, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19716732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24439663, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24577121, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26903630}.","PER3","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; kinase binding [GO:0019900]; transcription cis-regulatory region binding [GO:0000976]; transcription corepressor binding [GO:0001222]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]; circadian regulation of gene expression [GO:0032922]; entrainment of circadian clock by photoperiod [GO:0043153]; negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0000122]; protein stabilization [GO:0050821]; regulation of circadian sleep/wake cycle, sleep [GO:0045187]","O96017","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26903630}.

Hydrolyzes phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine and probably phosphatidylinositol with a possible preference for the former (PubMed:15695510). Has also a broad substrate specificity in terms of fatty acid moieties, hydrolyzing saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids at nearly equal rates from either the sn-1 or sn-2 position in diacyl phosphatidylcholine (PubMed:10833412, PubMed:10744668, PubMed:15695510, PubMed:15908428). However, has a weak activity toward polyunsaturated fatty acids at the sn-2 position, and thereby favors the production of 2-arachidonoyl lysophosphatidylcholine, a key branch point metabolite in eicosanoid signaling (PubMed:15908428). On the other hand, can produce arachidonic acid from the sn-1 position of diacyl phospholipid and from the sn-2 position of arachidonate-containing plasmalogen substrates (PubMed:15908428). Therefore, plays an important role in the mobilization of arachidonic acid in response to cellular stimuli and the generation of lipid second messengers (PubMed:15695510, PubMed:15908428). Can also hydrolyze lysophosphatidylcholine (PubMed:15695510). In the mitochondrial compartment, catalyzes the hydrolysis and release of oxidized aliphatic chains from cardiolipin and integrates mitochondrial bioenergetics and signaling.

MMEJ is an error-prone repair pathway that produces deletions of sequences from the strand being repaired and promotes genomic rearrangements, such as telomere fusions, some of them leading to cellular transformation (PubMed:25642963, PubMed:25643323). POLQ acts as an inhibitor of homology-recombination repair (HR) pathway by limiting RAD51 accumulation at resected ends (PubMed:25642963). POLQ-mediated MMEJ may be required to promote the survival of cells with a compromised HR repair pathway, thereby preventing genomic havoc by resolving unrepaired lesions (By similarity). The polymerase acts by binding directly the 2 ends of resected double-strand breaks, allowing microhomologous sequences in the overhangs to form base pairs. It then extends each strand from the base-paired region using the opposing overhang as a template. Requires partially resected DNA containing 2 to 6 base pairs of microhomology to perform MMEJ (PubMed:25643323). The polymerase activity is highly promiscuous: unlike most polymerases, promotes extension of ssDNA and partial ssDNA (pssDNA) substrates (PubMed:18503084, PubMed:21050863, PubMed:22135286). Also exhibits low-fidelity DNA synthesis, translesion synthesis and lyase activity, and it is implicated in interstrand-cross-link repair, base excision repair and DNA end-joining (PubMed:14576298, PubMed:18503084, PubMed:19188258, PubMed:24648516).

Involved in cell proliferation and cell growth arrest by positive and negative regulation of the cell cycle. Can promote cell growth by phosphorylating and activating RAF1, which mediates the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade, and/or by up-regulating CDKN1A, which facilitates active cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex formation in glioma cells. In intestinal cells stimulated by the phorbol ester PMA, can trigger a cell cycle arrest program which is associated with the accumulation of the hyper-phosphorylated growth-suppressive form of RB1 and induction of the CDK inhibitors CDKN1A and CDKN1B. Exhibits anti-apoptotic function in glioma cells and protects them from apoptosis by suppressing the p53/TP53-mediated activation of IGFBP3, and in leukemia cells mediates anti-apoptotic action by phosphorylating BCL2. During macrophage differentiation induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1), is translocated to the nucleus and is associated with macrophage development. After wounding, translocates from focal contacts to lamellipodia and participates in the modulation of desmosomal adhesion. Plays a role in cell motility by phosphorylating CSPG4, which induces association of CSPG4 with extensive lamellipodia at the cell periphery and polarization of the cell accompanied by increases in cell motility. During chemokine-induced CD4(+) T cell migration, phosphorylates CDC42-guanine exchange factor DOCK8 resulting in its dissociation from LRCH1 and the activation of GTPase CDC42 (PubMed:28028151). Is highly expressed in a number of cancer cells where it can act as a tumor promoter and is implicated in malignant phenotypes of several tumors such as gliomas and breast cancers. Negatively regulates myocardial contractility and positively regulates angiogenesis, platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in arteries. Mediates hypertrophic growth of neonatal cardiomyocytes, in part through a MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2)-dependent signaling pathway, and upon PMA treatment, is required to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy up to heart failure and death, by increasing protein synthesis, protein-DNA ratio and cell surface area. Regulates cardiomyocyte function by phosphorylating cardiac troponin T (TNNT2/CTNT), which induces significant reduction in actomyosin ATPase activity, myofilament calcium sensitivity and myocardial contractility. In angiogenesis, is required for full endothelial cell migration, adhesion to vitronectin (VTN), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)-dependent regulation of kinase activation and vascular tube formation. Involved in the stabilization of VEGFA mRNA at post-transcriptional level and mediates VEGFA-induced cell proliferation. In the regulation of calcium-induced platelet aggregation, mediates signals from the CD36/GP4 receptor for granule release, and activates the integrin heterodimer ITGA2B-ITGB3 through the RAP1GAP pathway for adhesion. During response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), may regulate selective LPS-induced macrophage functions involved in host defense and inflammation. But in some inflammatory responses, may negatively regulate NF-kappa-B-induced genes, through IL1A-dependent induction of NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA/IKBA). Upon stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), phosphorylates EIF4G1, which modulates EIF4G1 binding to MKNK1 and may be involved in the regulation of EIF4E phosphorylation. Phosphorylates KIT, leading to inhibition of KIT activity. Phosphorylates ATF2 which promotes cooperation between ATF2 and JUN, activating transcription. Phosphorylates SOCS2 at 'Ser-52' facilitating its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P20444, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10848585, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11909826, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12724315, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12832403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15016832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15504744, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15526160, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18056764, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19176525, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21576361, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23990668, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28028151, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9738012, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9830023, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9873035, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9927633}.","PRKCA","alphav-beta3 integrin-PKCalpha complex [GO:0035866]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; mitochondrial membrane [GO:0031966]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:0048471]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; calcium-dependent protein kinase C activity [GO:0004698]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; histone kinase activity (H3-T6 specific) [GO:0035403]; integrin binding [GO:0005178]; protein kinase activity [GO:0004672]; protein kinase C activity [GO:0004697]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]; angiogenesis [GO:0001525]; apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:0097190]; cell adhesion [GO:0007155]; desmosome assembly [GO:0002159]; intracellular signal transduction [GO:0035556]; mitotic nuclear membrane disassembly [GO:0007077]; negative regulation of glial cell apoptotic process [GO:0034351]; peptidyl-serine phosphorylation [GO:0018105]; peptidyl-threonine phosphorylation [GO:0018107]; positive regulation of adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway [GO:0106071]; positive regulation of angiogenesis [GO:0045766]; positive regulation of blood vessel endothelial cell migration [GO:0043536]; positive regulation of bone resorption [GO:0045780]; positive regulation of cardiac muscle hypertrophy [GO:0010613]; positive regulation of cell adhesion [GO:0045785]; positive regulation of cell migration [GO:0030335]; positive regulation of dense core granule biogenesis [GO:2000707]; positive regulation of endothelial cell migration [GO:0010595]; positive regulation of endothelial cell proliferation [GO:0001938]; positive regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade [GO:0070374]; positive regulation of lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0031666]; positive regulation of macrophage differentiation [GO:0045651]; positive regulation of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0045931]; post-translational protein modification [GO:0043687]; protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]; regulation of mRNA stability [GO:0043488]; regulation of platelet aggregation [GO:0090330]; response to interleukin-1 [GO:0070555]","Q15027; Q06481-5; Q66PJ3-4; Q13072; Q8N9N5-2; Q96A33; Q96LY2-2; P15169; P43234; O95424; O43598; P21728; P00533; P60228; Q96J88-3; Q8IVH2-2; Q96NE9-2; O14926; Q06547-3; P19440-3; Q9UJ42; P62805; Q9UBN7; P52597; Q92826; Q02363; Q96FT9-2; P17936; P26951; Q9BYR8; Q9Y234; P51884; Q9H213; P80192; Q15759; A0JLT2-2; Q9H8H3; Q8N983-3; P49821; Q2M1J6; Q9BRX2; Q9Y6X2; P11309-2; Q6P1J6-2; Q9UNA4; Q02156; P07225; Q3YEC7-3; O94844; Q9NWS8-3; Q9ULK6-3; P18077; P31431; Q99643; Q14141; Q01105-2; P37840; Q9Y5X0; P56693; Q9BRW5; O43761; P15884; Q3YBM2; P0CG48; P13051-2; Q8NB14; O95498; Q9NZC7-5; Q9BQ24; Q05CR2; Q8N0Y2-2; O15535; Q24008","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23990668}.

Thereby, it plays an essential role both in DNA replication and the cellular response to DNA damage. In the cellular response to DNA damage, the RPA complex controls DNA repair and DNA damage checkpoint activation. Through recruitment of ATRIP activates the ATR kinase a master regulator of the DNA damage response. It is required for the recruitment of the DNA double-strand break repair factors RAD51 and RAD52 to chromatin in response to DNA damage. Also recruits to sites of DNA damage proteins like XPA and XPG that are involved in nucleotide excision repair and is required for this mechanism of DNA repair. Also plays a role in base excision repair (BER) probably through interaction with UNG. Also recruits SMARCAL1/HARP, which is involved in replication fork restart, to sites of DNA damage.

In addition to its ADP:ATP antiporter activity, also involved in mitochondrial uncoupling and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) activity (By similarity). Plays a role in mitochondrial uncoupling by acting as a proton transporter: proton transport uncouples the proton flows via the electron transport chain and ATP synthase to reduce the efficiency of ATP production and cause mitochondrial thermogenesis (By similarity). Proton transporter activity is inhibited by ADP:ATP antiporter activity, suggesting that SLC25A5/ANT2 acts as a master regulator of mitochondrial energy output by maintaining a delicate balance between ATP production (ADP:ATP antiporter activity) and thermogenesis (proton transporter activity) (By similarity). Proton transporter activity requires free fatty acids as cofactor, but does not transport it (By similarity). Probably mediates mitochondrial uncoupling in tissues that do not express UCP1 (By similarity). Also plays a key role in mPTP opening, a non-specific pore that enables free passage of the mitochondrial membranes to solutes of up to 1.5 kDa, and which contributes to cell death (PubMed:31883789). It is however unclear if SLC25A5/ANT2 constitutes a pore-forming component of mPTP or regulates it (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of mitophagy independently of ADP:ATP antiporter activity: promotes mitophagy via interaction with TIMM44, leading to inhibit the presequence translocase TIMM23, thereby promoting stabilization of PINK1 (By similarity).

Also required for chondrocyte hypertrophy, both indirectly, by keeping the lineage fate of chondrocytes, and directly, by remaining present in upper hypertrophic cells and transactivating COL10A1 along with MEF2C (By similarity). Low lipid levels are the main nutritional determinant for chondrogenic commitment of skeletal progenitor cells: when lipids levels are low, FOXO (FOXO1 and FOXO3) transcription factors promote expression of SOX9, which induces chondrogenic commitment and suppresses fatty acid oxidation (By similarity).

Involved in many biological processes, such as bone development, angiogenesis, wound healing, cellular differentiation, chromatin modification and apoptosis (PubMed:1683874, PubMed:7935379, PubMed:9252372, PubMed:27270573). Acts as a protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase by mediating the cross-linking of proteins, such as ACO2, HSPB6, FN1, HMGB1, RAP1GDS1, SLC25A4/ANT1, SPP1 and WDR54 (PubMed:23941696, PubMed:24349085, PubMed:29618516, PubMed:30458214). Under physiological conditions, the protein cross-linking activity is inhibited by GTP; inhibition is relieved by Ca(2+) in response to various stresses (PubMed:7649299, PubMed:7592956, PubMed:18092889). When secreted, catalyzes cross-linking of proteins of the extracellular matrix, such as FN1 and SPP1 resulting in the formation of scaffolds (PubMed:12506096). Plays a key role during apoptosis, both by (1) promoting the cross-linking of cytoskeletal proteins resulting in condensation of the cytoplasm, and by (2) mediating cross-linking proteins of the extracellular matrix, resulting in the irreversible formation of scaffolds that stabilize the integrity of the dying cells before their clearance by phagocytosis, thereby preventing the leakage of harmful intracellular components (PubMed:7935379, PubMed:9252372). In addition to protein cross-linking, can use different monoamine substrates to catalyze a vast array of protein post-translational modifications: mediates aminylation of serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline or histamine into glutamine residues of target proteins to generate protein serotonylation, dopaminylation, noradrenalinylation or histaminylation, respectively (PubMed:23797785, PubMed:30867594). Mediates protein serotonylation of small GTPases during activation and aggregation of platelets, leading to constitutive activation of these GTPases (By similarity). Plays a key role in chromatin organization by mediating serotonylation and dopaminylation of histone H3 (PubMed:30867594, PubMed:32273471). Catalyzes serotonylation of 'Gln-5' of histone H3 (H3Q5ser) during serotonergic neuron differentiation, thereby facilitating transcription (PubMed:30867594). Acts as a mediator of neurotransmission-independent role of nuclear dopamine in ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons: catalyzes dopaminylation of 'Gln-5' of histone H3 (H3Q5dop), thereby regulating relapse-related transcriptional plasticity in the reward system (PubMed:32273471). Regulates vein remodeling by mediating serotonylation and subsequent inactivation of ATP2A2/SERCA2 (By similarity). Also acts as a protein deamidase by mediating the side chain deamidation of specific glutamine residues of proteins to glutamate (PubMed:9623982, PubMed:20547769).

Binds to U-rich sequences immediately downstream from a 5' splice sites in a uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U snRNP)-dependent fashion, thereby modulating alternative pre-RNA splicing (PubMed:11106748, PubMed:8576255). Preferably binds to the U-rich IAS1 sequence in a U1 snRNP-dependent manner; this binding is optimal if a 5' splice site is adjacent to IAS1 (By similarity). Activates the use of heterologous 5' splice sites; the activation depends on the intron sequence downstream from the 5' splice site, with a preference for a downstream U-rich sequence (PubMed:11106748). By interacting with SNRPC/U1-C, promotes recruitment and binding of spliceosomal U1 snRNP to 5' splice sites followed by U-rich sequences, thereby facilitating atypical 5' splice site recognition by U1 snRNP (PubMed:11106748, PubMed:12486009, PubMed:17488725). Activates splicing of alternative exons with weak 5' splice sites followed by a U-rich stretch on its own pre-mRNA and on TIAR mRNA (By similarity). Acts as a modulator of alternative splicing for the apoptotic FAS receptor, thereby promoting apoptosis (PubMed:11106748, PubMed:1934064, PubMed:17488725). Binds to the 5' splice site region of FAS intron 5 to promote accumulation of transcripts that include exon 6 at the expense of transcripts in which exon 6 is skipped, thereby leading to the transcription of a membrane-bound apoptotic FAS receptor, which promotes apoptosis (PubMed:11106748, PubMed:1934064, PubMed:17488725). Binds to a conserved AU-rich cis element in COL2A1 intron 2 and modulates alternative splicing of COL2A1 exon 2 (PubMed:17580305). Also binds to the equivalent AT-rich element in COL2A1 genomic DNA, and may thereby be involved in the regulation of transcription (PubMed:17580305). Binds specifically to a polypyrimidine-rich controlling element (PCE) located between the weak 5' splice site and the intronic splicing silencer of CFTR mRNA to promote exon 9 inclusion, thereby antagonizing PTB1 and its role in exon skipping of CFTR exon 9 (PubMed:14966131). Involved in the repression of mRNA translation by binding to AU-rich elements (AREs) located in mRNA 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), including target ARE-bearing mRNAs encoding TNF and PTGS2 (By similarity). Also participates in the cellular response to environmental stress, by acting downstream of the stress-induced phosphorylation of EIF2S1/EIF2A to promote the recruitment of untranslated mRNAs to cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs), leading to stress-induced translational arrest (PubMed:10613902).

Blocks viral replication early in the life cycle, after viral entry but before reverse transcription. In addition to acting as a capsid-specific restriction factor, also acts as a pattern recognition receptor that activates innate immune signaling in response to the retroviral capsid lattice. Binding to the viral capsid triggers its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and in concert with the heterodimeric ubiquitin conjugating enzyme complex UBE2V1-UBE2N (also known as UBC13-UEV1A complex) generates 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains, which in turn are catalysts in the autophosphorylation of the MAP3K7/TAK1 complex (includes TAK1, TAB2, and TAB3). Activation of the MAP3K7/TAK1 complex by autophosphorylation results in the induction and expression of NF-kappa-B and MAPK-responsive inflammatory genes, thereby leading to an innate immune response in the infected cell.
