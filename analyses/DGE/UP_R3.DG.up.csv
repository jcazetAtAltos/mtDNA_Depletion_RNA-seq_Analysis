Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways. Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation. AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome. The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components. Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation. AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface. AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules. AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway. During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (PubMed:23676497). The AP-2 beta subunit acts via its C-terminal appendage domain as a scaffolding platform for endocytic accessory proteins; at least some clathrin-associated sorting proteins (CLASPs) are recognized by their [DE]-X(1,2)-F-X-X-[FL]-X-X-X-R motif. The AP-2 beta subunit binds to clathrin heavy chain, promoting clathrin lattice assembly; clathrin displaces at least some CLASPs from AP2B1 which probably then can be positioned for further coat assembly. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14745134, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14985334, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15473838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19033387, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23676497}.","AP2B1","AP-2 adaptor complex [GO:0030122]; clathrin adaptor complex [GO:0030131]; clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle [GO:0045334]; clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle membrane [GO:0030669]; cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane [GO:0009898]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endocytic vesicle membrane [GO:0030666]; endolysosome membrane [GO:0036020]; glutamatergic synapse [GO:0098978]; membrane [GO:0016020]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; postsynapse [GO:0098794]; presynapse [GO:0098793]; clathrin binding [GO:0030276]; signal sequence binding [GO:0005048]; aorta development [GO:0035904]; clathrin-dependent endocytosis [GO:0072583]; coronary vasculature development [GO:0060976]; intracellular protein transport [GO:0006886]; kidney development [GO:0001822]; postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor internalization [GO:0098884]; synaptic vesicle endocytosis [GO:0048488]; ventricular septum development [GO:0003281]; vesicle-mediated transport [GO:0016192]","Q9UHB7; Q9UHB7-2; Q6ULP2; P52594; Q9Y6Q5; Q96CW1; Q14677; P42566; Q15811; P52292; Q5SW96; Q9UJ55; Q16626; Q8WWR8-2; P50542; Q96KG9; P12236; A8MWV9; Q9NVV9; O95153; Q99757; Q01081; Q8N4L5; P84092; Q9CR95; Q64729; P01023; Q92870-2; P05067; P05067-2; P49407; P54253; Q9UBB4; Q53TS8; P02461-2; P09172; Q14203-5; P14136; O95872; P78347-2; P42858; Q8WXH2; Q63ZY3; Q5SW96; Q17RB8; P51608; Q8IVT4; P40692; P19404; Q8WWR8-2; P29474; Q7Z3B4; Q99497; Q7Z412; Q9BXM7; D3DTS7; Q96HA1-2; O60260-5; P49768-2; Q9UIG4; P37840; P00441; Q13148; Q9BXU0; O14656-2; Q99757; Q01081; P09936; O95292; Q6ZN96","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14530274}.

Binds to asymmetric CRE's as a heterodimer and to palindromic CRE's as a homodimer (By similarity). Core effector of the ISR, which is required for adaptation to various stress such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, amino acid starvation, mitochondrial stress or oxidative stress (PubMed:32132707). During ISR, ATF4 translation is induced via an alternative ribosome translation re-initiation mechanism in response to EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation, and stress-induced ATF4 acts as a master transcription factor of stress-responsive genes in order to promote cell recovery (PubMed:32132706, PubMed:32132707). Promotes the transcription of genes linked to amino acid sufficiency and resistance to oxidative stress to protect cells against metabolic consequences of ER oxidation (By similarity). Activates the transcription of NLRP1, possibly in concert with other factors in response to ER stress (PubMed:26086088). Activates the transcription of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) in response to amino acid deprivation or ER stress (PubMed:11960987). However, when associated with DDIT3/CHOP, the transcriptional activation of the ASNS gene is inhibited in response to amino acid deprivation (PubMed:18940792). Together with DDIT3/CHOP, mediates programmed cell death by promoting the expression of genes involved in cellular amino acid metabolic processes, mRNA translation and the terminal unfolded protein response (terminal UPR), a cellular response that elicits programmed cell death when ER stress is prolonged and unresolved (By similarity). Together with DDIT3/CHOP, activates the transcription of the IRS-regulator TRIB3 and promotes ER stress-induced neuronal cell death by regulating the expression of BBC3/PUMA in response to ER stress (PubMed:15775988). May cooperate with the UPR transcriptional regulator QRICH1 to regulate ER protein homeostasis which is critical for cell viability in response to ER stress (PubMed:33384352). In the absence of stress, ATF4 translation is at low levels and it is required for normal metabolic processes such as embryonic lens formation, fetal liver hematopoiesis, bone development and synaptic plasticity (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of osteoblast differentiation in response to phosphorylation by RPS6KA3/RSK2: phosphorylation in osteoblasts enhances transactivation activity and promotes expression of osteoblast-specific genes and post-transcriptionally regulates the synthesis of Type I collagen, the main constituent of the bone matrix (PubMed:15109498). Cooperates with FOXO1 in osteoblasts to regulate glucose homeostasis through suppression of beta-cell production and decrease in insulin production (By similarity). Activates transcription of SIRT4 (By similarity). Regulates the circadian expression of the core clock component PER2 and the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 (By similarity). Binds in a circadian time-dependent manner to the cAMP response elements (CRE) in the SLC6A4 and PER2 promoters and periodically activates the transcription of these genes (By similarity). Mainly acts as a transcriptional activator in cellular stress adaptation, but it can also act as a transcriptional repressor: acts as a regulator of synaptic plasticity by repressing transcription, thereby inhibiting induction and maintenance of long-term memory (By similarity). Regulates synaptic functions via interaction with DISC1 in neurons, which inhibits ATF4 transcription factor activity by disrupting ATF4 dimerization and DNA-binding (PubMed:31444471). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q06507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11960987, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15109498, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15775988, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16682973, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17684156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18940792, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26086088, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31444471, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32132706, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32132707, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33384352}.;

Required for innate immunity to cytosolic, but not vacuolar, bacteria (By similarity).

Activated by direct binding to LPS without the need of an upstream sensor (PubMed:25119034). Involved in NLRP6 inflammasome-dependent activation in response to lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a cell-wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, which leads to CASP1 activation and IL1B and IL18 secretion (PubMed:33377178). Independently of NLRP3 inflammasome and CASP1, promotes pyroptosis, through GSDMD cleavage and activation, followed by IL1A, IL18 and HMGB1 release in response to non-canonical inflammasome activators (PubMed:26375003, PubMed:32109412). Plays a crucial role in the restriction of Salmonella typhimurium replication in colonic epithelial cells during infection: in later stages of the infection, LPS from cytosolic Salmonella triggers CASP4 activation, which catalyzes cleavage of GSDMD, resulting in pyroptosis of infected cells and their extrusion into the gut lumen, as well as in IL18 secretion (PubMed:25121752, PubMed:26375003, PubMed:25964352, PubMed:34671164, PubMed:32109412). Cleavage of GSDMD is not strictly dependent on the consensus cleavage site but depends on an exosite interface on CASP4 that recognizes and binds the Gasdermin-D, C-terminal (GSDMD-CT) part (PubMed:32109412). Pyroptosis limits bacterial replication, while cytokine secretion promotes the recruitment and activation of immune cells and triggers mucosal inflammation (PubMed:25121752, PubMed:26375003, PubMed:25964352). Involved in LPS-induced IL6 secretion; this activity may not require caspase enzymatic activity (PubMed:26508369).

Also plays a significant role in adipogenesis, as well as in the gluconeogenic pathway, liver regeneration, and hematopoiesis. The consensus recognition site is 5'-T[TG]NNGNAA[TG]-3'. Its functional capacity is governed by protein interactions and post-translational protein modifications. During early embryogenesis, plays essential and redundant roles with CEBPA. Has a promitotic effect on many cell types such as hepatocytes and adipocytes but has an antiproliferative effect on T-cells by repressing MYC expression, facilitating differentiation along the T-helper 2 lineage. Binds to regulatory regions of several acute-phase and cytokines genes and plays a role in the regulation of acute-phase reaction and inflammation. Also plays a role in intracellular bacteria killing (By similarity). During adipogenesis, is rapidly expressed and, after activation by phosphorylation, induces CEBPA and PPARG, which turn on the series of adipocyte genes that give rise to the adipocyte phenotype.

Part of the L-cysteine derived from the trans-sulfuration pathway is utilized for biosynthesis of the ubiquitous antioxidant glutathione (PubMed:18476726). Besides its role in the conversion of L-cystathionine into L-cysteine, it utilizes L-cysteine and L-homocysteine as substrates (at much lower rates than L,L-cystathionine) to produce the endogenous gaseous signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (PubMed:10212249, PubMed:19261609, PubMed:19961860, PubMed:19019829). In vitro, it converts two L-cysteine molecules into lanthionine and H2S, also two L-homocysteine molecules to homolanthionine and H2S, which can be particularly relevant under conditions of severe hyperhomocysteinemia (which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease) (PubMed:19261609). Lanthionine and homolanthionine are structural homologs of L,L-cystathionine that differ by the absence or presence of an extra methylene group, respectively (PubMed:19261609). Acts as a cysteine-protein sulfhydrase by mediating sulfhydration of target proteins: sulfhydration consists of converting -SH groups into -SSH on specific cysteine residues of target proteins such as GAPDH, PTPN1 and NF-kappa-B subunit RELA, thereby regulating their function (PubMed:22169477). By generating the gasotransmitter H2S, it participates in a number of physiological processes such as vasodilation, bone protection, and inflammation (Probable) (PubMed:29254196). Plays an essential role in myogenesis by contributing to the biogenesis of H2S in skeletal muscle tissue (By similarity). Can also accept homoserine as substrate (By similarity). Catalyzes the elimination of selenocystathionine (which can be derived from the diet) to yield selenocysteine, ammonia and 2-oxobutanoate (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P18757, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8VCN5, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10212249, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18476726, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19019829, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19261609, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19961860, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22169477, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29254196, ECO:0000303|PubMed:18476726, ECO:0000305|PubMed:18476726, ECO:0000305|PubMed:19019829}.","CTH","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; calmodulin binding [GO:0005516]; carbon-sulfur lyase activity [GO:0016846]; cystathionine gamma-lyase activity [GO:0004123]; homocysteine desulfhydrase activity [GO:0047982]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; L-cysteine desulfhydrase activity [GO:0080146]; L-cystine L-cysteine-lyase (deaminating) [GO:0044540]; pyridoxal phosphate binding [GO:0030170]; selenocystathionine gamma-lyase activity [GO:0098606]; cellular response to leukemia inhibitory factor [GO:1990830]; cysteine biosynthetic process [GO:0019344]; cysteine biosynthetic process via cystathionine [GO:0019343]; cysteine metabolic process [GO:0006534]; endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response [GO:0030968]; hydrogen sulfide biosynthetic process [GO:0070814]; lipid metabolic process [GO:0006629]; negative regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:2001234]; positive regulation of aortic smooth muscle cell differentiation [GO:1904831]; positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling [GO:0043123]; positive regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity [GO:0051092]; protein homotetramerization [GO:0051289]; protein sulfhydration [GO:0044524]; protein-pyridoxal-5-phosphate linkage via peptidyl-N6-pyridoxal phosphate-L-lysine [GO:0018272]; transsulfuration [GO:0019346]","P32929; Q96NT3; Q96NT3-2; Q96HA8; Q6P9E2","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.","ENST00000346806.2 [P32929-2];ENST00000370938.8 [P32929-1];ENST00000411986.6 [P32929-3];",1.00878511567096e-06

Binds various RNAs, such as rRNAs, snoRNAs, 7SK and, at lower extent, mRNAs (PubMed:25470060). In the nucleolus, localizes to rDNA locus, where it directly binds rRNAs and snoRNAs, and promotes rRNA transcription, processing and modification. Required for rRNA 2'-O-methylation, possibly by promoting the recruitment of late-acting snoRNAs SNORD56 and SNORD58 with pre-ribosomal complexes (PubMed:25470060, PubMed:25477391).

Functions in part via its role in ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal protein degradation. Functions downstream of ATM and phosphorylates p53/TP53 at 'Ser-46', and thereby contributes to the induction of apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Phosphorylates NFATC1, and thereby inhibits its accumulation in the nucleus and its transcription factor activity. Phosphorylates EIF2B5 at 'Ser-544', enabling its subsequent phosphorylation and inhibition by GSK3B. Likewise, phosphorylation of NFATC1, CRMP2/DPYSL2 and CRMP4/DPYSL3 promotes their subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3B. May play a general role in the priming of GSK3 substrates. Inactivates GYS1 by phosphorylation at 'Ser-641', and potentially also a second phosphorylation site, thus regulating glycogen synthesis. Mediates EDVP E3 ligase complex formation and is required for the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of KATNA1. Phosphorylates TERT at 'Ser-457', promoting TERT ubiquitination by the EDVP complex. Phosphorylates SIAH2, and thereby increases its ubiquitin ligase activity. Promotes the proteasomal degradation of MYC and JUN, and thereby regulates progress through the mitotic cell cycle and cell proliferation. Promotes proteasomal degradation of GLI2 and GLI3, and thereby plays a role in smoothened and sonic hedgehog signaling. Plays a role in cytoskeleton organization and neurite outgrowth via its phosphorylation of DCX and DPYSL2. Phosphorylates CRMP2/DPYSL2, CRMP4/DPYSL3, DCX, EIF2B5, EIF4EBP1, GLI2, GLI3, GYS1, JUN, MDM2, MYC, NFATC1, p53/TP53, TAU/MAPT and KATNA1.

The phosphorylation of EPRS1, induced by interferon-gamma, dissociates the protein from the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase multienzyme complex and recruits it to the GAIT complex that binds to stem loop-containing GAIT elements in the 3'-UTR of diverse inflammatory mRNAs (such as ceruplasmin), suppressing their translation. Interferon-gamma can therefore redirect, in specific cells, the EPRS1 function from protein synthesis to translation inhibition (PubMed:15479637, PubMed:23071094).

Plays a pivotal role in the protein quality control system, ensuring the correct folding of proteins, the re-folding of misfolded proteins and controlling the targeting of proteins for subsequent degradation (PubMed:21150129, PubMed:21148293, PubMed:24732912, PubMed:27916661, PubMed:23018488). This is achieved through cycles of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis and ADP release, mediated by co-chaperones (PubMed:21150129, PubMed:21148293, PubMed:24732912, PubMed:27916661, PubMed:23018488, PubMed:12526792). The co-chaperones have been shown to not only regulate different steps of the ATPase cycle of HSP70, but they also have an individual specificity such that one co-chaperone may promote folding of a substrate while another may promote degradation (PubMed:21150129, PubMed:21148293, PubMed:24732912, PubMed:27916661, PubMed:23018488, PubMed:12526792). The affinity of HSP70 for polypeptides is regulated by its nucleotide bound state. In the ATP-bound form, it has a low affinity for substrate proteins. However, upon hydrolysis of the ATP to ADP, it undergoes a conformational change that increases its affinity for substrate proteins. HSP70 goes through repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange, which permits cycles of substrate binding and release. The HSP70-associated co-chaperones are of three types: J-domain co-chaperones HSP40s (stimulate ATPase hydrolysis by HSP70), the nucleotide exchange factors (NEF) such as BAG1/2/3 (facilitate conversion of HSP70 from the ADP-bound to the ATP-bound state thereby promoting substrate release), and the TPR domain chaperones such as HOPX and STUB1 (PubMed:24318877, PubMed:27474739, PubMed:24121476, PubMed:26865365). Plays a critical role in mitochondrial import, delivers preproteins to the mitochondrial import receptor TOMM70 (PubMed:12526792). Acts as a repressor of transcriptional activation. Inhibits the transcriptional coactivator activity of CITED1 on Smad-mediated transcription. Component of the PRP19-CDC5L complex that forms an integral part of the spliceosome and is required for activating pre-mRNA splicing. May have a scaffolding role in the spliceosome assembly as it contacts all other components of the core complex.

Interacts on the one hand with the 3' poly-A tails that are present in all mRNA molecules, and on the other hand with the 7-methylguanosine cap structure of mRNAs containing a 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (5'TOP) motif, which is present in mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and several components of the translation machinery (PubMed:23711370, PubMed:25940091, PubMed:28650797, PubMed:29244122, PubMed:26206669, PubMed:28379136). The interaction with the 5' end of mRNAs containing a 5'TOP motif leads to translational repression by preventing the binding of EIF4G1 (PubMed:25940091, PubMed:28650797, PubMed:29244122, PubMed:28379136).

Under normal nutrient availability, interacts primarily with the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and increases protein synthesis (PubMed:23711370, PubMed:28650797). Associates with actively translating ribosomes and stimulates translation of mRNAs containing a 5'TOP motif, thereby regulating protein synthesis, and as a consequence, cell growth and proliferation (PubMed:20430826, PubMed:24532714).

Regulates many physiological processes including proliferation, scattering, morphogenesis and survival. Ligand binding at the cell surface induces autophosphorylation of MET on its intracellular domain that provides docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. Following activation by ligand, interacts with the PI3-kinase subunit PIK3R1, PLCG1, SRC, GRB2, STAT3 or the adapter GAB1. Recruitment of these downstream effectors by MET leads to the activation of several signaling cascades including the RAS-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, or PLCgamma-PKC. The RAS-ERK activation is associated with the morphogenetic effects while PI3K/AKT coordinates prosurvival effects. During embryonic development, MET signaling plays a role in gastrulation, development and migration of muscles and neuronal precursors, angiogenesis and kidney formation. In adults, participates in wound healing as well as organ regeneration and tissue remodeling. Promotes also differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells.

Mediates cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix via integrin-dependent signaling, by mediating angiotensin-2-induced activation of integrin beta-1 (ITGB1) in cardiac fibroblasts. Phosphorylates MARCKS, which phosphorylates and activates PTK2/FAK, leading to the spread of cardiomyocytes. Involved in the control of the directional transport of ITGB1 in mesenchymal cells by phosphorylating vimentin (VIM), an intermediate filament (IF) protein. In epithelial cells, associates with and phosphorylates keratin-8 (KRT8), which induces targeting of desmoplakin at desmosomes and regulates cell-cell contact. Phosphorylates IQGAP1, which binds to CDC42, mediating epithelial cell-cell detachment prior to migration. In HeLa cells, contributes to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced cell migration, and in human corneal epithelial cells, plays a critical role in wound healing after activation by HGF. During cytokinesis, forms a complex with YWHAB, which is crucial for daughter cell separation, and facilitates abscission by a mechanism which may implicate the regulation of RHOA. In cardiac myocytes, regulates myofilament function and excitation coupling at the Z-lines, where it is indirectly associated with F-actin via interaction with COPB1. During endothelin-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, mediates activation of PTK2/FAK, which is critical for cardiomyocyte survival and regulation of sarcomere length. Plays a role in the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy via persistent phosphorylation of troponin I (TNNI3). Involved in nerve growth factor (NFG)-induced neurite outgrowth and neuron morphological change independently of its kinase activity, by inhibition of RHOA pathway, activation of CDC42 and cytoskeletal rearrangement. May be involved in presynaptic facilitation by mediating phorbol ester-induced synaptic potentiation. Phosphorylates gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit gamma-2 (GABRG2), which reduces the response of GABA receptors to ethanol and benzodiazepines and may mediate acute tolerance to the intoxicating effects of ethanol. Upon PMA treatment, phosphorylates the capsaicin- and heat-activated cation channel TRPV1, which is required for bradykinin-induced sensitization of the heat response in nociceptive neurons. Is able to form a complex with PDLIM5 and N-type calcium channel, and may enhance channel activities and potentiates fast synaptic transmission by phosphorylating the pore-forming alpha subunit CACNA1B (CaV2.2). In prostate cancer cells, interacts with and phosphorylates STAT3, which increases DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of STAT3 and seems to be essential for prostate cancer cell invasion. Downstream of TLR4, plays an important role in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced immune response by phosphorylating and activating TICAM2/TRAM, which in turn activates the transcription factor IRF3 and subsequent cytokines production. In differentiating erythroid progenitors, is regulated by EPO and controls the protection against the TNFSF10/TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, via BCL2. May be involved in the regulation of the insulin-induced phosphorylation and activation of AKT1. Phosphorylates NLRP5/MATER and may thereby modulate AKT pathway activation in cumulus cells (PubMed:19542546). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11884385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1374067, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15355962, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16757566, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17603037, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17875639, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17875724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19542546}.","PRKCE","cell periphery [GO:0071944]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; Golgi apparatus [GO:0005794]; intermediate filament cytoskeleton [GO:0045111]; intracellular membrane-bounded organelle [GO:0043231]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:0048471]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; synapse [GO:0045202]; 14-3-3 protein binding [GO:0071889]; actin monomer binding [GO:0003785]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; calcium-dependent protein kinase C activity [GO:0004698]; calcium-independent protein kinase C activity [GO:0004699]; enzyme activator activity [GO:0008047]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; ethanol binding [GO:0035276]; metal ion binding [GO:0046872]; protein kinase activity [GO:0004672]; protein kinase C activity [GO:0004697]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; signaling receptor activator activity [GO:0030546]; apoptotic process [GO:0006915]; cell cycle [GO:0007049]; cell division [GO:0051301]; cell-substrate adhesion [GO:0031589]; cellular response to ethanol [GO:0071361]; cellular response to hypoxia [GO:0071456]; cellular response to prostaglandin E stimulus [GO:0071380]; establishment of localization in cell [GO:0051649]; Fc-gamma receptor signaling pathway involved in phagocytosis [GO:0038096]; insulin secretion [GO:0030073]; intracellular signal transduction [GO:0035556]; lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0031663]; locomotory exploration behavior [GO:0035641]; macrophage activation involved in immune response [GO:0002281]; MAPK cascade [GO:0000165]; mucus secretion [GO:0070254]; negative regulation of protein ubiquitination [GO:0031397]; negative regulation of sodium ion transmembrane transporter activity [GO:2000650]; peptidyl-serine phosphorylation [GO:0018105]; positive regulation of actin filament polymerization [GO:0030838]; positive regulation of cell-substrate adhesion [GO:0010811]; positive regulation of cellular glucuronidation [GO:2001031]; positive regulation of cytokinesis [GO:0032467]; positive regulation of epithelial cell migration [GO:0010634]; positive regulation of fibroblast migration [GO:0010763]; positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling [GO:0043123]; positive regulation of insulin secretion [GO:0032024]; positive regulation of lipid catabolic process [GO:0050996]; positive regulation of MAPK cascade [GO:0043410]; positive regulation of mucus secretion [GO:0070257]; positive regulation of protein localization to plasma membrane [GO:1903078]; positive regulation of synaptic transmission, GABAergic [GO:0032230]; positive regulation of wound healing [GO:0090303]; protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]; regulation of insulin secretion involved in cellular response to glucose stimulus [GO:0061178]; regulation of peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation [GO:0050730]; regulation of release of sequestered calcium ion into cytosol [GO:0051279]; response to morphine [GO:0043278]; signal transduction [GO:0007165]; synaptic transmission, GABAergic [GO:0051932]; TRAM-dependent toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway [GO:0035669]","P05067; P15056; P08238; C6GKH1; Q9BPZ7; P17252; Q15349; P37840; P63104","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17603037, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19542546}.

LUBAC conjugates linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and RIPK1 and is involved in activation of the canonical NF-kappa-B and the JNK signaling pathways (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181, PubMed:19136968).

LUBAC is recruited to the TNF-R1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC) following polyubiquitination of TNF-RSC components by BIRC2 and/or BIRC3 and to conjugate linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and possibly other components contributing to the stability of the complex (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181, PubMed:19136968). The LUBAC complex is also involved in innate immunity by conjugating linear polyubiquitin chains at the surface of bacteria invading the cytosol to form the ubiquitin coat surrounding bacteria (PubMed:28481331). LUBAC is not able to initiate formation of the bacterial ubiquitin coat, and can only promote formation of linear polyubiquitins on pre-existing ubiquitin (PubMed:28481331). The bacterial ubiquitin coat acts as an 'eat-me' signal for xenophagy and promotes NF-kappa-B activation (PubMed:28481331).

Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may be involved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycle regulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in proteotoxic stress response and cell cycle; Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linked is involved in endocytosis, DNA-damage responses as well as in signaling processes leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B. Linear polymer chains formed via attachment by the initiator Met lead to cell signaling. Ubiquitin is usually conjugated to Lys residues of target proteins, however, in rare cases, conjugation to Cys or Ser residues has been observed. When polyubiquitin is free (unanchored-polyubiquitin), it also has distinct roles, such as in activation of protein kinases, and in signaling. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16543144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34239127, ECO:0000303|PubMed:19754430}.; FUNCTION: [40S ribosomal protein S27a]: Component of the 40S subunit of the ribosome.","RPS27A","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; cytosolic ribosome [GO:0022626]; cytosolic small ribosomal subunit [GO:0022627]; endocytic vesicle membrane [GO:0030666]; endoplasmic reticulum membrane [GO:0005789]; endosome membrane [GO:0010008]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; extracellular space [GO:0005615]; membrane [GO:0016020]; mitochondrial outer membrane [GO:0005741]; nucleolus [GO:0005730]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; small ribosomal subunit [GO:0015935]; vesicle [GO:0031982]; metal ion binding [GO:0046872]; protein tag [GO:0031386]; RNA binding [GO:0003723]; structural constituent of ribosome [GO:0003735]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]; cytoplasmic translation [GO:0002181]; modification-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0019941]; protein ubiquitination [GO:0016567]; translation [GO:0006412]","Q13137; Q15038; Q6ICB0; I6L9I8; Q92567-2; P04792; P42858; Q99732; Q8N3F0; Q96CS7; Q9NRQ2; P54725; Q9Y3C5; Q9UMX0; Q9UHD9; O76024","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: [Ubiquitin]: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250}.

Endosomal acidification leads to iron release. The apotransferrin-receptor complex is then recycled to the cell surface with a return to neutral pH and the concomitant loss of affinity of apotransferrin for its receptor. Transferrin receptor is necessary for development of erythrocytes and the nervous system (By similarity). A second ligand, the heditary hemochromatosis protein HFE, competes for binding with transferrin for an overlapping C-terminal binding site. Positively regulates T and B cell proliferation through iron uptake (PubMed:26642240). Acts as a lipid sensor that regulates mitochondrial fusion by regulating activation of the JNK pathway (PubMed:26214738). When dietary levels of stearate (C18:0) are low, promotes activation of the JNK pathway, resulting in HUWE1-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the mitofusin MFN2 and inhibition of mitochondrial fusion (PubMed:26214738).

In TLR and RLR signaling pathways, acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase promoting the synthesis of 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains on several substrates such as ASC that lead to the activation of the type I interferon response or the inflammasome (PubMed:25847972, PubMed:27980081). Following the activation of certain TLRs such as TLR4, acts as a negative NF-kappa-B regulator, possibly to avoid unregulated inflammatory response, and its degradation via 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination is required for MAPK activation and production of inflammatory cytokines. Alternatively, when TLR4 orchestrates bacterial expulsion, TRAF3 undergoes 'Lys-33'-linked polyubiquitination and subsequently binds to RALGDS, mobilizing the exocyst complex to rapidly expel intracellular bacteria back for clearance (PubMed:27438768). Acts also as a constitutive negative regulator of the alternative NF-kappa-B pathway, which controls B-cell survival and lymphoid organ development. Required for normal antibody isotype switching from IgM to IgG. Plays a role T-cell dependent immune responses. Down-regulates proteolytic processing of NFKB2, and thereby inhibits non-canonical activation of NF-kappa-B.
