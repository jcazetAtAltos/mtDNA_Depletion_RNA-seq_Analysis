Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways. Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation. AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome. The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components. Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation. AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface. AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules. AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway. During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (PubMed:23676497). The AP-2 beta subunit acts via its C-terminal appendage domain as a scaffolding platform for endocytic accessory proteins; at least some clathrin-associated sorting proteins (CLASPs) are recognized by their [DE]-X(1,2)-F-X-X-[FL]-X-X-X-R motif. The AP-2 beta subunit binds to clathrin heavy chain, promoting clathrin lattice assembly; clathrin displaces at least some CLASPs from AP2B1 which probably then can be positioned for further coat assembly. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14745134, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14985334, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15473838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19033387, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23676497}.","AP2B1","AP-2 adaptor complex [GO:0030122]; clathrin adaptor complex [GO:0030131]; clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle [GO:0045334]; clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle membrane [GO:0030669]; cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane [GO:0009898]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endocytic vesicle membrane [GO:0030666]; endolysosome membrane [GO:0036020]; glutamatergic synapse [GO:0098978]; membrane [GO:0016020]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; postsynapse [GO:0098794]; presynapse [GO:0098793]; clathrin binding [GO:0030276]; signal sequence binding [GO:0005048]; aorta development [GO:0035904]; clathrin-dependent endocytosis [GO:0072583]; coronary vasculature development [GO:0060976]; intracellular protein transport [GO:0006886]; kidney development [GO:0001822]; postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor internalization [GO:0098884]; synaptic vesicle endocytosis [GO:0048488]; ventricular septum development [GO:0003281]; vesicle-mediated transport [GO:0016192]","Q9UHB7; Q9UHB7-2; Q6ULP2; P52594; Q9Y6Q5; Q96CW1; Q14677; P42566; Q15811; P52292; Q5SW96; Q9UJ55; Q16626; Q8WWR8-2; P50542; Q96KG9; P12236; A8MWV9; Q9NVV9; O95153; Q99757; Q01081; Q8N4L5; P84092; Q9CR95; Q64729; P01023; Q92870-2; P05067; P05067-2; P49407; P54253; Q9UBB4; Q53TS8; P02461-2; P09172; Q14203-5; P14136; O95872; P78347-2; P42858; Q8WXH2; Q63ZY3; Q5SW96; Q17RB8; P51608; Q8IVT4; P40692; P19404; Q8WWR8-2; P29474; Q7Z3B4; Q99497; Q7Z412; Q9BXM7; D3DTS7; Q96HA1-2; O60260-5; P49768-2; Q9UIG4; P37840; P00441; Q13148; Q9BXU0; O14656-2; Q99757; Q01081; P09936; O95292; Q6ZN96","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14530274}.

Binds to asymmetric CRE's as a heterodimer and to palindromic CRE's as a homodimer (By similarity). Core effector of the ISR, which is required for adaptation to various stress such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, amino acid starvation, mitochondrial stress or oxidative stress (PubMed:32132707). During ISR, ATF4 translation is induced via an alternative ribosome translation re-initiation mechanism in response to EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation, and stress-induced ATF4 acts as a master transcription factor of stress-responsive genes in order to promote cell recovery (PubMed:32132706, PubMed:32132707). Promotes the transcription of genes linked to amino acid sufficiency and resistance to oxidative stress to protect cells against metabolic consequences of ER oxidation (By similarity). Activates the transcription of NLRP1, possibly in concert with other factors in response to ER stress (PubMed:26086088). Activates the transcription of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) in response to amino acid deprivation or ER stress (PubMed:11960987). However, when associated with DDIT3/CHOP, the transcriptional activation of the ASNS gene is inhibited in response to amino acid deprivation (PubMed:18940792). Together with DDIT3/CHOP, mediates programmed cell death by promoting the expression of genes involved in cellular amino acid metabolic processes, mRNA translation and the terminal unfolded protein response (terminal UPR), a cellular response that elicits programmed cell death when ER stress is prolonged and unresolved (By similarity). Together with DDIT3/CHOP, activates the transcription of the IRS-regulator TRIB3 and promotes ER stress-induced neuronal cell death by regulating the expression of BBC3/PUMA in response to ER stress (PubMed:15775988). May cooperate with the UPR transcriptional regulator QRICH1 to regulate ER protein homeostasis which is critical for cell viability in response to ER stress (PubMed:33384352). In the absence of stress, ATF4 translation is at low levels and it is required for normal metabolic processes such as embryonic lens formation, fetal liver hematopoiesis, bone development and synaptic plasticity (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of osteoblast differentiation in response to phosphorylation by RPS6KA3/RSK2: phosphorylation in osteoblasts enhances transactivation activity and promotes expression of osteoblast-specific genes and post-transcriptionally regulates the synthesis of Type I collagen, the main constituent of the bone matrix (PubMed:15109498). Cooperates with FOXO1 in osteoblasts to regulate glucose homeostasis through suppression of beta-cell production and decrease in insulin production (By similarity). Activates transcription of SIRT4 (By similarity). Regulates the circadian expression of the core clock component PER2 and the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 (By similarity). Binds in a circadian time-dependent manner to the cAMP response elements (CRE) in the SLC6A4 and PER2 promoters and periodically activates the transcription of these genes (By similarity). Mainly acts as a transcriptional activator in cellular stress adaptation, but it can also act as a transcriptional repressor: acts as a regulator of synaptic plasticity by repressing transcription, thereby inhibiting induction and maintenance of long-term memory (By similarity). Regulates synaptic functions via interaction with DISC1 in neurons, which inhibits ATF4 transcription factor activity by disrupting ATF4 dimerization and DNA-binding (PubMed:31444471). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q06507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11960987, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15109498, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15775988, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16682973, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17684156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18940792, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26086088, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31444471, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32132706, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32132707, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33384352}.;

Thiol protease that cleaves a tetrapeptide after an Asp residue at position P1: catalyzes cleavage of CGAS, GSDMD and IL18 (PubMed:7797510, PubMed:15326478, PubMed:23516580, PubMed:26375003, PubMed:28314590, PubMed:32109412). Required for innate immunity to cytosolic, but not vacuolar, bacteria (By similarity). Plays a key role in NLRP3-dependent CASP1 activation and IL1B and IL18 secretion in response to non-canonical activators, such as UVB radiation, cholera enterotoxin subunit B and cytosolic LPS (PubMed:26508369, PubMed:22246630, PubMed:23516580, PubMed:24879791, PubMed:25119034, PubMed:26173988, PubMed:26174085, PubMed:25964352). Activated by direct binding to LPS without the need of an upstream sensor (PubMed:25119034). Involved in NLRP6 inflammasome-dependent activation in response to lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a cell-wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, which leads to CASP1 activation and IL1B and IL18 secretion (PubMed:33377178). Independently of NLRP3 inflammasome and CASP1, promotes pyroptosis, through GSDMD cleavage and activation, followed by IL1A, IL18 and HMGB1 release in response to non-canonical inflammasome activators (PubMed:26375003, PubMed:32109412). Plays a crucial role in the restriction of Salmonella typhimurium replication in colonic epithelial cells during infection: in later stages of the infection, LPS from cytosolic Salmonella triggers CASP4 activation, which catalyzes cleavage of GSDMD, resulting in pyroptosis of infected cells and their extrusion into the gut lumen, as well as in IL18 secretion (PubMed:25121752, PubMed:26375003, PubMed:25964352, PubMed:34671164, PubMed:32109412). Cleavage of GSDMD is not strictly dependent on the consensus cleavage site but depends on an exosite interface on CASP4 that recognizes and binds the Gasdermin-D, C-terminal (GSDMD-CT) part (PubMed:32109412). Pyroptosis limits bacterial replication, while cytokine secretion promotes the recruitment and activation of immune cells and triggers mucosal inflammation (PubMed:25121752, PubMed:26375003, PubMed:25964352). Involved in LPS-induced IL6 secretion; this activity may not require caspase enzymatic activity (PubMed:26508369). Involved in cell death induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress and by treatment with cytotoxic APP peptides found in Alzheimer's patient brains (PubMed:23661706, PubMed:15123740, PubMed:22246630). Catalyzes cleavage and maturation of IL18 (PubMed:15326478). In contrast, it does not directly process IL1B (PubMed:7743998, PubMed:7797592, PubMed:7797510). During non-canonical inflammasome activation, cuts CGAS and may play a role in the regulation of antiviral innate immune activation (PubMed:28314590). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P70343, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15123740, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15326478, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22246630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23516580, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23661706, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24879791, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25119034, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25121752, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25964352, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26173988, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26174085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26375003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26508369, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28314590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32109412, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33377178, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34671164, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7743998, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7797510, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7797592}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) In response to the Td92 surface protein of the periodontal pathogen T.denticola, activated by cathepsin CTSG which leads to production and secretion of IL1A and pyroptosis of gingival fibroblasts. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:29077095}.","CASP4","AIM2 inflammasome complex [GO:0097169]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; endoplasmic reticulum membrane [GO:0005789]; extracellular region [GO:0005576]; IPAF inflammasome complex [GO:0072557]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; NLRP3 inflammasome complex [GO:0072559]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; protein-containing complex [GO:0032991]; CARD domain binding [GO:0050700]; cysteine-type endopeptidase activity [GO:0004197]; cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:0097199]; apoptotic process [GO:0006915]; cellular response to amyloid-beta [GO:1904646]; defense response to Gram-positive bacterium [GO:0050830]; inflammatory response [GO:0006954]; innate immune response [GO:0045087]; intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:0097193]; intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress [GO:0070059]; positive regulation of inflammatory response [GO:0050729]; positive regulation of interleukin-18-mediated signaling pathway [GO:2000494]; positive regulation of tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway [GO:1903265]; protein autoprocessing [GO:0016540]; proteolysis [GO:0006508]; pyroptosis [GO:0070269]; regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0042981]; regulation of inflammatory response [GO:0050727]","","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23661706}.

Also plays a significant role in adipogenesis, as well as in the gluconeogenic pathway, liver regeneration, and hematopoiesis. The consensus recognition site is 5'-T[TG]NNGNAA[TG]-3'. Its functional capacity is governed by protein interactions and post-translational protein modifications. During early embryogenesis, plays essential and redundant roles with CEBPA. Has a promitotic effect on many cell types such as hepatocytes and adipocytes but has an antiproliferative effect on T-cells by repressing MYC expression, facilitating differentiation along the T-helper 2 lineage. Binds to regulatory regions of several acute-phase and cytokines genes and plays a role in the regulation of acute-phase reaction and inflammation. Also plays a role in intracellular bacteria killing (By similarity). During adipogenesis, is rapidly expressed and, after activation by phosphorylation, induces CEBPA and PPARG, which turn on the series of adipocyte genes that give rise to the adipocyte phenotype. The delayed transactivation of the CEBPA and PPARG genes by CEBPB appears necessary to allow mitotic clonal expansion and thereby progression of terminal differentiation (PubMed:20829347).

In vitro, it converts two L-cysteine molecules into lanthionine and H2S, also two L-homocysteine molecules to homolanthionine and H2S, which can be particularly relevant under conditions of severe hyperhomocysteinemia (which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease) (PubMed:19261609). Lanthionine and homolanthionine are structural homologs of L,L-cystathionine that differ by the absence or presence of an extra methylene group, respectively (PubMed:19261609). Acts as a cysteine-protein sulfhydrase by mediating sulfhydration of target proteins: sulfhydration consists of converting -SH groups into -SSH on specific cysteine residues of target proteins such as GAPDH, PTPN1 and NF-kappa-B subunit RELA, thereby regulating their function (PubMed:22169477). By generating the gasotransmitter H2S, it participates in a number of physiological processes such as vasodilation, bone protection, and inflammation (Probable) (PubMed:29254196). Plays an essential role in myogenesis by contributing to the biogenesis of H2S in skeletal muscle tissue (By similarity). Can also accept homoserine as substrate (By similarity). Catalyzes the elimination of selenocystathionine (which can be derived from the diet) to yield selenocysteine, ammonia and 2-oxobutanoate (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P18757, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8VCN5, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10212249, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18476726, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19019829, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19261609, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19961860, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22169477, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29254196, ECO:0000303|PubMed:18476726, ECO:0000305|PubMed:18476726, ECO:0000305|PubMed:19019829}.","CTH","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; calmodulin binding [GO:0005516]; carbon-sulfur lyase activity [GO:0016846]; cystathionine gamma-lyase activity [GO:0004123]; homocysteine desulfhydrase activity [GO:0047982]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; L-cysteine desulfhydrase activity [GO:0080146]; L-cystine L-cysteine-lyase (deaminating) [GO:0044540]; pyridoxal phosphate binding [GO:0030170]; selenocystathionine gamma-lyase activity [GO:0098606]; cellular response to leukemia inhibitory factor [GO:1990830]; cysteine biosynthetic process [GO:0019344]; cysteine biosynthetic process via cystathionine [GO:0019343]; cysteine metabolic process [GO:0006534]; endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response [GO:0030968]; hydrogen sulfide biosynthetic process [GO:0070814]; lipid metabolic process [GO:0006629]; negative regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:2001234]; positive regulation of aortic smooth muscle cell differentiation [GO:1904831]; positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling [GO:0043123]; positive regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity [GO:0051092]; protein homotetramerization [GO:0051289]; protein sulfhydration [GO:0044524]; protein-pyridoxal-5-phosphate linkage via peptidyl-N6-pyridoxal phosphate-L-lysine [GO:0018272]; transsulfuration [GO:0019346]","P32929; Q96NT3; Q96NT3-2; Q96HA8; Q6P9E2","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.","ENST00000346806.2 [P32929-2];ENST00000370938.8 [P32929-1];ENST00000411986.6 [P32929-3];",1.00878511567096e-06

Functions in part via its role in ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal protein degradation. Functions downstream of ATM and phosphorylates p53/TP53 at 'Ser-46', and thereby contributes to the induction of apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Phosphorylates NFATC1, and thereby inhibits its accumulation in the nucleus and its transcription factor activity. Phosphorylates EIF2B5 at 'Ser-544', enabling its subsequent phosphorylation and inhibition by GSK3B. Likewise, phosphorylation of NFATC1, CRMP2/DPYSL2 and CRMP4/DPYSL3 promotes their subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3B. May play a general role in the priming of GSK3 substrates. Inactivates GYS1 by phosphorylation at 'Ser-641', and potentially also a second phosphorylation site, thus regulating glycogen synthesis. Mediates EDVP E3 ligase complex formation and is required for the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of KATNA1. Phosphorylates TERT at 'Ser-457', promoting TERT ubiquitination by the EDVP complex. Phosphorylates SIAH2, and thereby increases its ubiquitin ligase activity. Promotes the proteasomal degradation of MYC and JUN, and thereby regulates progress through the mitotic cell cycle and cell proliferation. Promotes proteasomal degradation of GLI2 and GLI3, and thereby plays a role in smoothened and sonic hedgehog signaling. Plays a role in cytoskeleton organization and neurite outgrowth via its phosphorylation of DCX and DPYSL2. Phosphorylates CRMP2/DPYSL2, CRMP4/DPYSL3, DCX, EIF2B5, EIF4EBP1, GLI2, GLI3, GYS1, JUN, MDM2, MYC, NFATC1, p53/TP53, TAU/MAPT and KATNA1. Can phosphorylate histone H1, histone H3 and histone H2B (in vitro). Can phosphorylate CARHSP1 (in vitro). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11311121, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12588975, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14593110, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15910284, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16511445, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16611631, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18455992, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18599021, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19287380, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22307329, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22878263, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23362280, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9748265}.","DYRK2","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytoskeleton [GO:0005856]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; ribonucleoprotein complex [GO:1990904]; ubiquitin ligase complex [GO:0000151]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; magnesium ion binding [GO:0000287]; manganese ion binding [GO:0030145]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004712]; protein tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004713]; cellular response to DNA damage stimulus [GO:0006974]; intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in response to DNA damage by p53 class mediator [GO:0042771]; negative regulation of calcineurin-NFAT signaling cascade [GO:0070885]; peptidyl-serine phosphorylation [GO:0018105]; peptidyl-threonine phosphorylation [GO:0018107]; positive regulation of glycogen biosynthetic process [GO:0045725]; protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]; regulation of signal transduction by p53 class mediator [GO:1901796]; smoothened signaling pathway [GO:0007224]","Q9NR20; Q13422; Q9BQD3; Q9BRK4; P23497; O43379; Q96C00","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.

Directly represses transcription of classical E2F transcription factors such as E2F1. Acts as a regulator of S-phase by recognizing and binding the E2-related site 5'-TTCCCGCC-3' and mediating repression of G1/S-regulated genes. Plays a key role in polyploidization of cells in placenta and liver by regulating the endocycle, probably by repressing genes promoting cytokinesis and antagonizing action of classical E2F proteins (E2F1, E2F2 and/or E2F3). Required for placental development by promoting polyploidization of trophoblast giant cells. Also involved in DNA damage response: up-regulated by p53/TP53 following genotoxic stress and acts as a downstream effector of p53/TP53-dependent repression by mediating repression of indirect p53/TP53 target genes involved in DNA replication. Acts as a promoter of sprouting angiogenesis, possibly by acting as a transcription activator: associates with HIF1A, recognizes and binds the VEGFA promoter, which is different from canonical E2 recognition site, and activates expression of the VEGFA gene.

Regulates the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and seems to be implicated in the development of blood vessels and the tubular system of lung. May also play a role in the formation of the endothelium that gives rise to the blood brain barrier. Potent activator of the Tie-2 tyrosine kinase expression. Activation requires recruitment of transcriptional coactivators such as CREBBP and probably EP300.

The phosphorylation of EPRS1, induced by interferon-gamma, dissociates the protein from the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase multienzyme complex and recruits it to the GAIT complex that binds to stem loop-containing GAIT elements in the 3'-UTR of diverse inflammatory mRNAs (such as ceruplasmin), suppressing their translation. Interferon-gamma can therefore redirect, in specific cells, the EPRS1 function from protein synthesis to translation inhibition (PubMed:15479637, PubMed:23071094).

Plays a pivotal role in the protein quality control system, ensuring the correct folding of proteins, the re-folding of misfolded proteins and controlling the targeting of proteins for subsequent degradation (PubMed:21150129, PubMed:21148293, PubMed:24732912, PubMed:27916661, PubMed:23018488). This is achieved through cycles of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis and ADP release, mediated by co-chaperones (PubMed:21150129, PubMed:21148293, PubMed:24732912, PubMed:27916661, PubMed:23018488, PubMed:12526792). The co-chaperones have been shown to not only regulate different steps of the ATPase cycle of HSP70, but they also have an individual specificity such that one co-chaperone may promote folding of a substrate while another may promote degradation (PubMed:21150129, PubMed:21148293, PubMed:24732912, PubMed:27916661, PubMed:23018488, PubMed:12526792). The affinity of HSP70 for polypeptides is regulated by its nucleotide bound state. In the ATP-bound form, it has a low affinity for substrate proteins. However, upon hydrolysis of the ATP to ADP, it undergoes a conformational change that increases its affinity for substrate proteins. HSP70 goes through repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange, which permits cycles of substrate binding and release. The HSP70-associated co-chaperones are of three types: J-domain co-chaperones HSP40s (stimulate ATPase hydrolysis by HSP70), the nucleotide exchange factors (NEF) such as BAG1/2/3 (facilitate conversion of HSP70 from the ADP-bound to the ATP-bound state thereby promoting substrate release), and the TPR domain chaperones such as HOPX and STUB1 (PubMed:24318877, PubMed:27474739, PubMed:24121476, PubMed:26865365). Plays a critical role in mitochondrial import, delivers preproteins to the mitochondrial import receptor TOMM70 (PubMed:12526792). Acts as a repressor of transcriptional activation. Inhibits the transcriptional coactivator activity of CITED1 on Smad-mediated transcription. Component of the PRP19-CDC5L complex that forms an integral part of the spliceosome and is required for activating pre-mRNA splicing. May have a scaffolding role in the spliceosome assembly as it contacts all other components of the core complex.

Acts as a negative regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis by mediating the retention of the SCAP-SREBP complex in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby blocking the processing of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) SREBF1/SREBP1 and SREBF2/SREBP2 (PubMed:12202038, PubMed:16399501, PubMed:32322062). Binds oxysterol, including 25-hydroxycholesterol, regulating interaction with SCAP and retention of the SCAP-SREBP complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:32322062).

Also regulates cholesterol synthesis by regulating degradation of HMGCR: initiates the sterol-mediated ubiquitin-mediated endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of HMGCR via recruitment of the reductase to the ubiquitin ligases AMFR/gp78 and/or RNF139 (PubMed:12535518, PubMed:16168377, PubMed:22143767).

Interacts on the one hand with the 3' poly-A tails that are present in all mRNA molecules, and on the other hand with the 7-methylguanosine cap structure of mRNAs containing a 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (5'TOP) motif, which is present in mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and several components of the translation machinery (PubMed:23711370, PubMed:25940091, PubMed:28650797, PubMed:29244122, PubMed:26206669, PubMed:28379136).

Upon binding to R-spondins (RSPO1, RSPO2, RSPO3 or RSPO4), associates with phosphorylated LRP6 and frizzled receptors that are activated by extracellular Wnt receptors, triggering the canonical Wnt signaling pathway to increase expression of target genes. In contrast to classical G-protein coupled receptors, does not activate heterotrimeric G-proteins to transduce the signal. Its function as activator of the Wnt signaling pathway is required for the development of various organs, including liver, kidney, intestine, bone, reproductive tract and eye. May also act as a receptor for norrin (NDP), such results however require additional confirmation in vivo. Required during spermatogenesis to activate the Wnt signaling pathway in peritubular myoid cells. Required for the maintenance of intestinal stem cells and Paneth cell differentiation in postnatal intestinal crypts. Acts as a regulator of bone formation and remodeling. Involved in kidney development; required for maintaining the ureteric bud in an undifferentiated state. Involved in the development of the anterior segment of the eye. Required during erythropoiesis. Also acts as a negative regulator of innate immunity by inhibiting TLR2/TLR4 associated pattern-recognition and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Plays an important role in regulating the circadian rhythms of plasma lipids, partially through regulating the rhythmic expression of MTTP (By similarity).

With MAP3K3/MKK3, catalyzes the concomitant phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in the MAP kinases p38 MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and MAPK14 and plays an important role in the regulation of cellular responses to cytokines and all kinds of stresses. Especially, MAP2K3/MKK3 and MAP2K6/MKK6 are both essential for the activation of MAPK11 and MAPK13 induced by environmental stress, whereas MAP2K6/MKK6 is the major MAPK11 activator in response to TNF. MAP2K6/MKK6 also phosphorylates and activates PAK6. The p38 MAP kinase signal transduction pathway leads to direct activation of transcription factors. Nuclear targets of p38 MAP kinase include the transcription factors ATF2 and ELK1. Within the p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway, MAP3K6/MKK6 mediates phosphorylation of STAT4 through MAPK14 activation, and is therefore required for STAT4 activation and STAT4-regulated gene expression in response to IL-12 stimulation. The pathway is also crucial for IL-6-induced SOCS3 expression and down-regulation of IL-6-mediated gene induction; and for IFNG-dependent gene transcription. Has a role in osteoclast differentiation through NF-kappa-B transactivation by TNFSF11, and in endochondral ossification and since SOX9 is another likely downstream target of the p38 MAPK pathway. MAP2K6/MKK6 mediates apoptotic cell death in thymocytes.

Regulates many physiological processes including proliferation, scattering, morphogenesis and survival. Ligand binding at the cell surface induces autophosphorylation of MET on its intracellular domain that provides docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. Following activation by ligand, interacts with the PI3-kinase subunit PIK3R1, PLCG1, SRC, GRB2, STAT3 or the adapter GAB1. Recruitment of these downstream effectors by MET leads to the activation of several signaling cascades including the RAS-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, or PLCgamma-PKC. The RAS-ERK activation is associated with the morphogenetic effects while PI3K/AKT coordinates prosurvival effects. During embryonic development, MET signaling plays a role in gastrulation, development and migration of muscles and neuronal precursors, angiogenesis and kidney formation. In adults, participates in wound healing as well as organ regeneration and tissue remodeling. Promotes also differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells.

The BNC reduces molecular oxygen to 2 water molecules using 4 electrons from cytochrome c in the IMS and 4 protons from the mitochondrial matrix. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P00420}.","MT-CO3","integral component of membrane [GO:0016021]; mitochondrial inner membrane [GO:0005743]; mitochondrial membrane [GO:0031966]; mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV [GO:0005751]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; respiratory chain complex IV [GO:0045277]; cytochrome-c oxidase activity [GO:0004129]; electron transfer activity [GO:0009055]; oxidoreduction-driven active transmembrane transporter activity [GO:0015453]; aerobic respiration [GO:0009060]; cellular respiration [GO:0045333]; mitochondrial electron transport, cytochrome c to oxygen [GO:0006123]; respiratory chain complex IV assembly [GO:0008535]","P37840","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion inner membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:30030519}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:30030519}.","ENST00000362079.2;",1.56999499637917e-16

Catalyzes the first, rate-limiting step of ketone body utilization in extrahepatic tissues, by transferring coenzyme A (CoA) from a donor thiolester species (succinyl-CoA) to an acceptor carboxylate (acetoacetate), and produces acetoacetyl-CoA. Acetoacetyl-CoA is further metabolized by acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase into two acetyl-CoA molecules which enter the citric acid cycle for energy production (PubMed:10964512). Forms a dimeric enzyme where both of the subunits are able to form enzyme-CoA thiolester intermediates, but only one subunit is competent to transfer the CoA moiety to the acceptor carboxylate (3-oxo acid) and produce a new acyl-CoA.

Involved in cell proliferation and cell growth arrest by positive and negative regulation of the cell cycle. Can promote cell growth by phosphorylating and activating RAF1, which mediates the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade, and/or by up-regulating CDKN1A, which facilitates active cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex formation in glioma cells. In intestinal cells stimulated by the phorbol ester PMA, can trigger a cell cycle arrest program which is associated with the accumulation of the hyper-phosphorylated growth-suppressive form of RB1 and induction of the CDK inhibitors CDKN1A and CDKN1B. Exhibits anti-apoptotic function in glioma cells and protects them from apoptosis by suppressing the p53/TP53-mediated activation of IGFBP3, and in leukemia cells mediates anti-apoptotic action by phosphorylating BCL2. During macrophage differentiation induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1), is translocated to the nucleus and is associated with macrophage development. After wounding, translocates from focal contacts to lamellipodia and participates in the modulation of desmosomal adhesion. Plays a role in cell motility by phosphorylating CSPG4, which induces association of CSPG4 with extensive lamellipodia at the cell periphery and polarization of the cell accompanied by increases in cell motility. During chemokine-induced CD4(+) T cell migration, phosphorylates CDC42-guanine exchange factor DOCK8 resulting in its dissociation from LRCH1 and the activation of GTPase CDC42 (PubMed:28028151). Is highly expressed in a number of cancer cells where it can act as a tumor promoter and is implicated in malignant phenotypes of several tumors such as gliomas and breast cancers. Negatively regulates myocardial contractility and positively regulates angiogenesis, platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in arteries. Mediates hypertrophic growth of neonatal cardiomyocytes, in part through a MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2)-dependent signaling pathway, and upon PMA treatment, is required to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy up to heart failure and death, by increasing protein synthesis, protein-DNA ratio and cell surface area. Regulates cardiomyocyte function by phosphorylating cardiac troponin T (TNNT2/CTNT), which induces significant reduction in actomyosin ATPase activity, myofilament calcium sensitivity and myocardial contractility. In angiogenesis, is required for full endothelial cell migration, adhesion to vitronectin (VTN), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)-dependent regulation of kinase activation and vascular tube formation. Involved in the stabilization of VEGFA mRNA at post-transcriptional level and mediates VEGFA-induced cell proliferation. In the regulation of calcium-induced platelet aggregation, mediates signals from the CD36/GP4 receptor for granule release, and activates the integrin heterodimer ITGA2B-ITGB3 through the RAP1GAP pathway for adhesion. During response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), may regulate selective LPS-induced macrophage functions involved in host defense and inflammation. But in some inflammatory responses, may negatively regulate NF-kappa-B-induced genes, through IL1A-dependent induction of NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA/IKBA). Upon stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), phosphorylates EIF4G1, which modulates EIF4G1 binding to MKNK1 and may be involved in the regulation of EIF4E phosphorylation. Phosphorylates KIT, leading to inhibition of KIT activity. Phosphorylates ATF2 which promotes cooperation between ATF2 and JUN, activating transcription.

Mediates cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix via integrin-dependent signaling, by mediating angiotensin-2-induced activation of integrin beta-1 (ITGB1) in cardiac fibroblasts. Phosphorylates MARCKS, which phosphorylates and activates PTK2/FAK, leading to the spread of cardiomyocytes. Involved in the control of the directional transport of ITGB1 in mesenchymal cells by phosphorylating vimentin (VIM), an intermediate filament (IF) protein. In epithelial cells, associates with and phosphorylates keratin-8 (KRT8), which induces targeting of desmoplakin at desmosomes and regulates cell-cell contact. Phosphorylates IQGAP1, which binds to CDC42, mediating epithelial cell-cell detachment prior to migration. In HeLa cells, contributes to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced cell migration, and in human corneal epithelial cells, plays a critical role in wound healing after activation by HGF. During cytokinesis, forms a complex with YWHAB, which is crucial for daughter cell separation, and facilitates abscission by a mechanism which may implicate the regulation of RHOA. In cardiac myocytes, regulates myofilament function and excitation coupling at the Z-lines, where it is indirectly associated with F-actin via interaction with COPB1. During endothelin-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, mediates activation of PTK2/FAK, which is critical for cardiomyocyte survival and regulation of sarcomere length.

LUBAC conjugates linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and RIPK1 and is involved in activation of the canonical NF-kappa-B and the JNK signaling pathways (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181, PubMed:19136968). Linear ubiquitination mediated by the LUBAC complex interferes with TNF-induced cell death and thereby prevents inflammation (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181). LUBAC is recruited to the TNF-R1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC) following polyubiquitination of TNF-RSC components by BIRC2 and/or BIRC3 and to conjugate linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and possibly other components contributing to the stability of the complex (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181, PubMed:19136968). The LUBAC complex is also involved in innate immunity by conjugating linear polyubiquitin chains at the surface of bacteria invading the cytosol to form the ubiquitin coat surrounding bacteria (PubMed:28481331). LUBAC is not able to initiate formation of the bacterial ubiquitin coat, and can only promote formation of linear polyubiquitins on pre-existing ubiquitin (PubMed:28481331). The bacterial ubiquitin coat acts as an 'eat-me' signal for xenophagy and promotes NF-kappa-B activation (PubMed:28481331).

The small ribosomal subunit (SSU) binds messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and translates the encoded message by selecting cognate aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The large subunit (LSU) contains the ribosomal catalytic site termed the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), which catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds, thereby polymerizing the amino acids delivered by tRNAs into a polypeptide chain. The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome through a tunnel in the LSU and interact with protein factors that function in enzymatic processing, targeting, and the membrane insertion of nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel. As part of the 5S RNP/5S ribonucleoprotein particle it is an essential component of the LSU, required for its formation and the maturation of rRNAs (PubMed:12962325, PubMed:19061985, PubMed:24120868, PubMed:23636399). It also couples ribosome biogenesis to p53/TP53 activation.

Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may be involved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycle regulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in proteotoxic stress response and cell cycle; Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linked is involved in endocytosis, DNA-damage responses as well as in signaling processes leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B. Linear polymer chains formed via attachment by the initiator Met lead to cell signaling. Ubiquitin is usually conjugated to Lys residues of target proteins, however, in rare cases, conjugation to Cys or Ser residues has been observed.

Plays an important role in cellular stress response. Contributes to regulation of renal Na(+) retention, renal K(+) elimination, salt appetite, gastric acid secretion, intestinal Na(+)/H(+) exchange and nutrient transport, insulin-dependent salt sensitivity of blood pressure, salt sensitivity of peripheral glucose uptake, cardiac repolarization and memory consolidation. Up-regulates Na(+) channels: SCNN1A/ENAC, SCN5A and ASIC1/ACCN2, K(+) channels: KCNJ1/ROMK1, KCNA1-5, KCNQ1-5 and KCNE1, epithelial Ca(2+) channels: TRPV5 and TRPV6, chloride channels: BSND, CLCN2 and CFTR, glutamate transporters: SLC1A3/EAAT1, SLC1A2 /EAAT2, SLC1A1/EAAT3, SLC1A6/EAAT4 and SLC1A7/EAAT5, amino acid transporters: SLC1A5/ASCT2, SLC38A1/SN1 and SLC6A19, creatine transporter: SLC6A8, Na(+)/dicarboxylate cotransporter: SLC13A2/NADC1, Na(+)-dependent phosphate cotransporter: SLC34A2/NAPI-2B, glutamate receptor: GRIK2/GLUR6. Up-regulates carriers: SLC9A3/NHE3, SLC12A1/NKCC2, SLC12A3/NCC, SLC5A3/SMIT, SLC2A1/GLUT1, SLC5A1/SGLT1 and SLC15A2/PEPT2. Regulates enzymes: GSK3A/B, PMM2 and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase, and transcription factors: CTNNB1 and nuclear factor NF-kappa-B. Stimulates sodium transport into epithelial cells by enhancing the stability and expression of SCNN1A/ENAC. This is achieved by phosphorylating the NEDD4L ubiquitin E3 ligase, promoting its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, thereby preventing it from binding to SCNN1A/ENAC and targeting it for degradation. Regulates store-operated Ca(+2) entry (SOCE) by stimulating ORAI1 and STIM1. Regulates KCNJ1/ROMK1 directly via its phosphorylation or indirectly via increased interaction with SLC9A3R2/NHERF2. Phosphorylates MDM2 and activates MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53/TP53. Phosphorylates MAPT/TAU and mediates microtubule depolymerization and neurite formation in hippocampal neurons. Phosphorylates SLC2A4/GLUT4 and up-regulates its activity. Phosphorylates APBB1/FE65 and promotes its localization to the nucleus. Phosphorylates MAPK1/ERK2 and activates it by enhancing its interaction with MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Phosphorylates FBXW7 and plays an inhibitory role in the NOTCH1 signaling. Phosphorylates FOXO1 resulting in its relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Phosphorylates FOXO3, promoting its exit from the nucleus and interference with FOXO3-dependent transcription. Phosphorylates BRAF and MAP3K3/MEKK3 and inhibits their activity. Phosphorylates SLC9A3/NHE3 in response to dexamethasone, resulting in its activation and increased localization at the cell membrane. Phosphorylates CREB1. Necessary for vascular remodeling during angiogenesis. Sustained high levels and activity may contribute to conditions such as hypertension and diabetic nephropathy.

Proton transporter activity is inhibited by ADP:ATP antiporter activity, suggesting that SLC25A6/ANT3 acts as a master regulator of mitochondrial energy output by maintaining a delicate balance between ATP production (ADP:ATP antiporter activity) and thermogenesis (proton transporter activity) (By similarity). Proton transporter activity requires free fatty acids as cofactor, but does not transport it (By similarity). Also plays a key role in mPTP opening, a non-specific pore that enables free passage of the mitochondrial membranes to solutes of up to 1.5 kDa, and which contributes to cell death (PubMed:15033708). It is however unclear if SLC25A6/ANT3 constitutes a pore-forming component of mPTP or regulates it (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:G2QNH0, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P48962, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15033708}.","SLC25A6","integral component of membrane [GO:0016021]; membrane [GO:0016020]; mitochondrial inner membrane [GO:0005743]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; TIM23 mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase complex [GO:0005744]; ATP:ADP antiporter activity [GO:0005471]; apoptotic process [GO:0006915]; mitochondrial ADP transmembrane transport [GO:0140021]; mitochondrial ATP transmembrane transport [GO:1990544]; negative regulation of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization involved in apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:1901029]","P63010; Q15323; Q5S007; Q9BRK4; Q9UJV3-2; Q5JR59; Q7Z3S9; Q8WW24; Q13077; P36406; Q15654; P21796; P0C0U1","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion inner membrane {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P02722}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000255}.

Specifically binds the 5'-ACAAAG-3' DNA motif present in enhancers and super-enhancers and promotes expression of genes important for chondrogenesis, including cartilage matrix protein-coding genes COL2A1, COL4A2, COL9A1, COL11A2 and ACAN, SOX5 and SOX6 (PubMed:8640233). Also binds to some promoter regions (By similarity). Plays a central role in successive steps of chondrocyte differentiation (By similarity). Absolutely required for precartilaginous condensation, the first step in chondrogenesis during which skeletal progenitors differentiate into prechondrocytes (By similarity). Together with SOX5 and SOX6, required for overt chondrogenesis when condensed prechondrocytes differentiate into early stage chondrocytes, the second step in chondrogenesis (By similarity). Later, required to direct hypertrophic maturation and block osteoblast differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes: maintains chondrocyte columnar proliferation, delays prehypertrophy and then prevents osteoblastic differentiation of chondrocytes by lowering beta-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling and RUNX2 expression (By similarity). Also required for chondrocyte hypertrophy, both indirectly, by keeping the lineage fate of chondrocytes, and directly, by remaining present in upper hypertrophic cells and transactivating COL10A1 along with MEF2C (By similarity). Low lipid levels are the main nutritional determinant for chondrogenic commitment of skeletal progenitor cells: when lipids levels are low, FOXO (FOXO1 and FOXO3) transcription factors promote expression of SOX9, which induces chondrogenic commitment and suppresses fatty acid oxidation (By similarity). Mechanistically, helps, but is not required, to remove epigenetic signatures of transcriptional repression and deposit active promoter and enhancer marks at chondrocyte-specific genes (By similarity). Acts in cooperation with the Hedgehog pathway-dependent GLI (GLI1 and GLI3) transcription factors (By similarity). In addition to cartilage development, also acts as a regulator of proliferation and differentiation in epithelial stem/progenitor cells: involved in the lung epithelium during branching morphogenesis, by balancing proliferation and differentiation and regulating the extracellular matrix (By similarity). Controls epithelial branching during kidney development (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q04887, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24038782, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8640233}.","SOX9","chromatin [GO:0000785]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654];

When secreted, catalyzes cross-linking of proteins of the extracellular matrix, such as FN1 and SPP1 resulting in the formation of scaffolds (PubMed:12506096). Plays a key role during apoptosis, both by (1) promoting the cross-linking of cytoskeletal proteins resulting in condensation of the cytoplasm, and by (2) mediating cross-linking proteins of the extracellular matrix, resulting in the irreversible formation of scaffolds that stabilize the integrity of the dying cells before their clearance by phagocytosis, thereby preventing the leakage of harmful intracellular components (PubMed:7935379, PubMed:9252372). In addition to protein cross-linking, can use different monoamine substrates to catalyze a vast array of protein post-translational modifications: mediates aminylation of serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline or histamine into glutamine residues of target proteins to generate protein serotonylation, dopaminylation, noradrenalinylation or histaminylation, respectively (PubMed:23797785, PubMed:30867594). Mediates protein serotonylation of small GTPases during activation and aggregation of platelets, leading to constitutive activation of these GTPases (By similarity). Plays a key role in chromatin organization by mediating serotonylation and dopaminylation of histone H3 (PubMed:30867594, PubMed:32273471). Catalyzes serotonylation of 'Gln-5' of histone H3 (H3Q5ser) during serotonergic neuron differentiation, thereby facilitating transcription (PubMed:30867594). Acts as a mediator of neurotransmission-independent role of nuclear dopamine in ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons: catalyzes dopaminylation of 'Gln-5' of histone H3 (H3Q5dop), thereby regulating relapse-related transcriptional plasticity in the reward system (PubMed:32273471). Regulates vein remodeling by mediating serotonylation and subsequent inactivation of ATP2A2/SERCA2 (By similarity). Also acts as a protein deamidase by mediating the side chain deamidation of specific glutamine residues of proteins to glutamate (PubMed:9623982, PubMed:20547769). Catalyzes specific deamidation of protein gliadin, a component of wheat gluten in the diet (PubMed:9623982). May also act as an isopeptidase cleaving the previously formed cross-links (PubMed:26250429, PubMed:27131890). Also able to participate in signaling pathways independently of its acyltransferase activity: acts as a signal transducer in alpha-1 adrenergic receptor-mediated stimulation of phospholipase C-delta (PLCD) activity and is required for coupling alpha-1 adrenergic agonists to the stimulation of phosphoinositide lipid metabolism (PubMed:8943303). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08587, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P21981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12506096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1683874, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18092889, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20547769, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23797785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23941696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24349085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26250429, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27131890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29618516, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30458214, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30867594, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31991788, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32273471, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7592956, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7649299, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7935379, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8943303, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9252372, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9623982, ECO:0000303|PubMed:27270573}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 2]: Has cytotoxic activity: is able to induce apoptosis independently of its acyltransferase activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17116873}.","TGM2","chromatin [GO:0000785]; collagen-containing extracellular matrix [GO:0062023]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; extracellular matrix [GO:0031012]; focal adhesion [GO:0005925]; intrinsic component of plasma membrane [GO:0031226]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:0048471]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; calcium ion binding [GO:0005509]; GTP binding [GO:0005525]; histone dopaminyltransferase activity [GO:0120297]; histone serotonyltransferase activity [GO:0120295]; peptidase activity [GO:0008233]; peptide histaminyltransferase activity [GO:0120299]; peptide noradrenalinyltransferase activity [GO:0120298]; protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase activity [GO:0003810]; protein-glutamine glutaminase activity [GO:0050568]; apoptotic cell clearance [GO:0043277]; bone development [GO:0060348]; branching involved in salivary gland morphogenesis [GO:0060445]; cellular response to cocaine [GO:0071314]; cellular response to dopamine [GO:1903351]; cellular response to serotonin [GO:1904015]; negative regulation of endoplasmic reticulum calcium ion concentration [GO:0032471]; peptide cross-linking [GO:0018149]; phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway [GO:0007200]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of cell adhesion [GO:0045785]; positive regulation of GTPase activity [GO:0043547]; positive regulation of mitochondrial calcium ion concentration [GO:0051561]; positive regulation of neurogenesis [GO:0050769]; positive regulation of small GTPase mediated signal transduction [GO:0051057]; protein deamination [GO:0018277]; protein homooligomerization [GO:0051260]; proteolysis [GO:0006508]; regulation of apoptotic cell clearance [GO:2000425]; regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0042981]; salivary gland cavitation [GO:0060662]","Q12802; PRO_0000000092 [P05067]; PRO_0000005794 [P39060]; P02751; P08727; PRO_0000018520 [P28300]; Q04206; P40337; G5E9A7; O00429-3; P50570-2; P29692-2; Q06787-7; P04792; P42858; O60333-2; D3DTS7; P60891; Q5T160; Q8N488; Q14141; O95416; Q7Z699; O14656-2; Q86WV8; P02766; Q9NYH9; O76024","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24349085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29618516, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9575137}.

In TLR and RLR signaling pathways, acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase promoting the synthesis of 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains on several substrates such as ASC that lead to the activation of the type I interferon response or the inflammasome (PubMed:25847972, PubMed:27980081). Following the activation of certain TLRs such as TLR4, acts as a negative NF-kappa-B regulator, possibly to avoid unregulated inflammatory response, and its degradation via 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination is required for MAPK activation and production of inflammatory cytokines. Alternatively, when TLR4 orchestrates bacterial expulsion, TRAF3 undergoes 'Lys-33'-linked polyubiquitination and subsequently binds to RALGDS, mobilizing the exocyst complex to rapidly expel intracellular bacteria back for clearance (PubMed:27438768). Acts also as a constitutive negative regulator of the alternative NF-kappa-B pathway, which controls B-cell survival and lymphoid organ development. Required for normal antibody isotype switching from IgM to IgG. Plays a role T-cell dependent immune responses. Down-regulates proteolytic processing of NFKB2, and thereby inhibits non-canonical activation of NF-kappa-B.
