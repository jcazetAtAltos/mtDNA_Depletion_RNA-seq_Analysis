Has an essential role in B cell development and is required for proper B cell receptor signaling (PubMed:30718914). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14525538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15705588, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22317921, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30718914}.","SLC39A7","endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; endoplasmic reticulum membrane [GO:0005789]; Golgi apparatus [GO:0005794]; integral component of membrane [GO:0016021]; membrane [GO:0016020]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; zinc ion transmembrane transporter activity [GO:0005385]; B cell differentiation [GO:0030183]; cellular zinc ion homeostasis [GO:0006882]; zinc ion transmembrane transport [GO:0071577]","Q13520; Q13323; Q9UGL9; P68400; P48165; Q9H3M0; Q8IUG1; Q6L8G8; Q9BYQ4; Q5T7P2; Q5T751; Q5T754; Q5TA81; Q5TA82; Q5TA78; Q5TCM9; Q5T871; Q9UGC6; Q6UXX9-2; Q3SXP7; O95436-2; P49901; O43610; Q9NUH8; Q9UBN6; Q86WB7-2; Q8WWY7","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14525538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30718914}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000255}.
