This protein has a peptide stretch, called the 'bait region' which contains specific cleavage sites for different proteinases. When a proteinase cleaves the bait region, a conformational change is induced in the protein which traps the proteinase. The entrapped enzyme remains active against low molecular weight substrates (activity against high molecular weight substrates is greatly reduced). Following cleavage in the bait region, a thioester bond is hydrolyzed and mediates the covalent binding of the protein to the proteinase.","A2M","blood microparticle [GO:0072562]; collagen-containing extracellular matrix [GO:0062023]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; extracellular region [GO:0005576]; extracellular space [GO:0005615]; platelet alpha granule lumen [GO:0031093]; brain-derived neurotrophic factor binding [GO:0048403]; calcium-dependent protein binding [GO:0048306]; endopeptidase inhibitor activity [GO:0004866]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; growth factor binding [GO:0019838]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; interleukin-1 binding [GO:0019966]; interleukin-8 binding [GO:0019959]; nerve growth factor binding [GO:0048406]; protease binding [GO:0002020]; serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity [GO:0004867]; signaling receptor binding [GO:0005102]; tumor necrosis factor binding [GO:0043120]; acute inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus [GO:0002438]; acute-phase response [GO:0006953]; embryonic liver development [GO:1990402]; luteinization [GO:0001553]; negative regulation of complement activation, lectin pathway [GO:0001869]; response to carbon dioxide [GO:0010037]; response to glucocorticoid [GO:0051384]; response to nutrient [GO:0007584]; response to prostaglandin E [GO:0034695]; stem cell differentiation [GO:0048863]","Q6PCB6; P63010-2; Q9UII2; Q8WUW1; Q92478; Q9UNS2; P04141; P35222; Q7L576; Q9NR90-2; Q9UHI6; Q9H147; O75616; Q9Y261-2; Q6PIV2; Q9ULV1; P0C0S5; P68431; P09017; Q6DN90-2; Q92993; Q92993-2; P60409; Q8IUC2; Q9UPM6; Q8TBB1; P07948; Q8TDB4; A4FUJ8; P41218; Q9Y605; Q96FW1; Q6GQQ9-2; Q99497; O75925; P27986-2; O75626-3; P57729; Q9ULX5; Q96D59; P04271; Q16637-3; Q7Z6I5; Q9UNE7; O75558; Q8N4C7; P43405-2; P28347-2; Q86WT6-2; Q8WVJ9; P10599; Q9BVJ6; Q9UBQ0-2; Q96AX1; Q8N895; Q99KR7","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted {ECO:0000269|PubMed:6203908}.","ENST00000318602.12;",0.00828777831231233

Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways. Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation. AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome. The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components. Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation. AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface. AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules. AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway. During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (PubMed:23676497). The AP-2 alpha subunit binds polyphosphoinositide-containing lipids, positioning AP-2 on the membrane. The AP-2 alpha subunit acts via its C-terminal appendage domain as a scaffolding platform for endocytic accessory proteins. The AP-2 alpha and AP-2 sigma subunits are thought to contribute to the recognition of the [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] motif (By similarity). {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14745134, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15473838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19033387, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23676497}.","AP2A1","AP-2 adaptor complex [GO:0030122]; clathrin coat of trans-Golgi network vesicle [GO:0030130]; clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle [GO:0045334]; clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle membrane [GO:0030669]; cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane [GO:0009898]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endocytic vesicle membrane [GO:0030666]; endolysosome membrane [GO:0036020]; filopodium tip [GO:0032433]; membrane [GO:0016020]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; postsynapse [GO:0098794]; cargo adaptor activity [GO:0140312]; clathrin adaptor activity [GO:0035615]; low-density lipoprotein particle receptor binding [GO:0050750]; protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]; clathrin-dependent endocytosis [GO:0072583]; endocytosis [GO:0006897]; Golgi to endosome transport [GO:0006895]; intracellular protein transport [GO:0006886]; negative regulation of hyaluronan biosynthetic process [GO:1900126]; postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor internalization [GO:0098884]; receptor-mediated endocytosis [GO:0006898]; vesicle-mediated transport [GO:0016192]","","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16262731}.

After the penetration of retroviral nucleocapsids into target cells of infection and the initiation of reverse transcription, it can induce the conversion of cytosine to uracil in the minus-sense single-strand viral DNA, leading to G-to-A hypermutations in the subsequent plus-strand viral DNA. The resultant detrimental levels of mutations in the proviral genome, along with a deamination-independent mechanism that works prior to the proviral integration, together exert efficient antiretroviral effects in infected target cells. Selectively targets single-stranded DNA and does not deaminate double-stranded DNA or single- or double-stranded RNA.

Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF).

Initiates the canonical BMP signaling cascade by associating with type I receptor BMPR1A and type II receptor BMPR2 (PubMed:25868050, PubMed:8006002). Once all three components are bound together in a complex at the cell surface, BMPR2 phosphorylates and activates BMPR1A.

The XPC complex recognizes a wide spectrum of damaged DNA characterized by distortions of the DNA helix such as single-stranded loops, mismatched bubbles or single-stranded overhangs. The orientation of XPC complex binding appears to be crucial for inducing a productive NER. XPC complex is proposed to recognize and to interact with unpaired bases on the undamaged DNA strand which is followed by recruitment of the TFIIH complex and subsequent scanning for lesions in the opposite strand in a 5'-to-3' direction by the NER machinery. Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) which are formed upon UV-induced DNA damage esacpe detection by the XPC complex due to a low degree of structural perurbation. Instead they are detected by the UV-DDB complex which in turn recruits and cooperates with the XPC complex in the respective DNA repair.; FUNCTION: As a component of the TREX-2 complex, involved in the export of mRNAs to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pores. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22307388, ECO:0000305|PubMed:23591820}.","CETN2","9+2 motile cilium [GO:0097729]; apical part of cell [GO:0045177]; centriole [GO:0005814]; centrosome [GO:0005813]; ciliary basal body [GO:0036064]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; nuclear pore nuclear basket [GO:0044615]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; photoreceptor connecting cilium [GO:0032391]; transcription export complex 2 [GO:0070390]; XPC complex [GO:0071942]; calcium ion binding [GO:0005509]; G-protein beta/gamma-subunit complex binding [GO:0031683]; heterotrimeric G-protein binding [GO:0032795]; microtubule binding [GO:0008017]; cell division [GO:0051301]; centriole replication [GO:0007099]; mitotic cell cycle [GO:0000278]; mRNA transport [GO:0051028]; nucleotide-excision repair [GO:0006289]; protein transport [GO:0015031]; regulation of cytokinesis [GO:0032465]; spermatogenesis [GO:0007283]","O43303; P42858; Q96PV4; Q8NA72; Q8NA72-3; A8K8P3; Q2NKQ1-4; Q9H0E7; Q01831","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, microtubule organizing center, centrosome {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14654843}.

In the absence of Wnt, forms a complex with AXIN1, AXIN2, APC, CSNK1A1 and GSK3B that promotes phosphorylation on N-terminal Ser and Thr residues and ubiquitination of CTNNB1 via BTRC and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:17524503, PubMed:18077326, PubMed:18086858, PubMed:18957423, PubMed:21262353, PubMed:22155184, PubMed:22647378, PubMed:22699938).

In interphase, colocalizes with CROCC between CEP250 puncta at the proximal end of centrioles, and this localization is dependent on CROCC and CEP250. In mitosis, when NEK2 activity increases, it localizes to centrosomes at spindle poles independent of CROCC. Colocalizes with CDK5 in the cell-cell contacts and plasma membrane of undifferentiated and differentiated neuroblastoma cells.

Involved in multiple cellular processes, including pre-mRNA splicing, alternative splicing, ribosomal RNA processing and miRNA processing, as well as transcription regulation. Regulates the alternative splicing of exons exhibiting specific features (PubMed:12138182, PubMed:23022728, PubMed:24910439, PubMed:22266867). For instance, promotes the inclusion of AC-rich alternative exons in CD44 transcripts (PubMed:12138182). This function requires the RNA helicase activity (PubMed:12138182, PubMed:23022728, PubMed:24910439, PubMed:22266867). Affects NFAT5 and histone macro-H2A.1/MACROH2A1 alternative splicing in a CDK9-dependent manner (PubMed:26209609, PubMed:22266867). In NFAT5, promotes the introduction of alternative exon 4, which contains 2 stop codons and may target NFAT5 exon 4-containing transcripts to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, leading to the down-regulation of NFAT5 protein (PubMed:22266867). Affects splicing of mediators of steroid hormone signaling pathway, including kinases that phosphorylates ESR1, such as CDK2, MAPK1 and GSK3B, and transcriptional regulators, such as CREBBP, MED1, NCOR1 and NCOR2. By affecting GSK3B splicing, participates in ESR1 and AR stabilization (PubMed:24275493). In myoblasts and epithelial cells, cooperates with HNRNPH1 to control the splicing of specific subsets of exons (PubMed:24910439). In addition to binding mature mRNAs, also interacts with certain pri-microRNAs, including MIR663/miR-663a, MIR99B/miR-99b, and MIR6087/miR-6087 (PubMed:25126784). Binds pri-microRNAs on the 3' segment flanking the stem loop via the 5'-[ACG]CAUC[ACU]-3' consensus sequence (PubMed:24581491). Required for the production of subsets of microRNAs, including MIR21 and MIR125B1 (PubMed:24581491, PubMed:27478153). May be involved not only in microRNA primary transcript processing, but also stabilization (By similarity). Participates in MYC down-regulation at high cell density through the production of MYC-targeting microRNAs (PubMed:24581491). Along with DDX5, may be involved in the processing of the 32S intermediate into the mature 28S ribosomal RNA (PubMed:17485482). Promoter-specific transcription regulator, functioning as a coactivator or corepressor depending on the context of the promoter and the transcriptional complex in which it exists (PubMed:15298701). Enhances NFAT5 transcriptional activity (PubMed:22266867). Synergizes with TP53 in the activation of the MDM2 promoter; this activity requires acetylation on lysine residues (PubMed:17226766, PubMed:20663877, PubMed:19995069). May also coactivate MDM2 transcription through a TP53-independent pathway (PubMed:17226766). Coactivates MMP7 transcription (PubMed:17226766). Along with CTNNB1, coactivates MYC, JUN, FOSL1 and cyclin D1/CCND1 transcription (PubMed:17699760). Alone or in combination with DDX5 and/or SRA1 non-coding RNA, plays a critical role in promoting the assembly of proteins required for the formation of the transcription initiation complex and chromatin remodeling leading to coactivation of MYOD1-dependent transcription. This helicase-independent activity is required for skeletal muscle cells to properly differentiate into myotubes (PubMed:17011493, PubMed:24910439). During epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, coregulates SMAD-dependent transcriptional activity, directly controlling key effectors of differentiation, including miRNAs which in turn directly repress its expression (PubMed:24910439). Plays a role in estrogen and testosterone signaling pathway at several levels. Mediates the use of alternative promoters in estrogen-responsive genes and regulates transcription and splicing of a large number of steroid hormone target genes (PubMed:24275493, PubMed:20406972, PubMed:20663877, PubMed:19995069). Contrary to splicing regulation activity, transcriptional coregulation of the estrogen receptor ESR1 is helicase-independent (PubMed:19718048, PubMed:24275493). Plays a role in innate immunity. Specifically restricts bunyavirus infection, including Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) or La Crosse virus (LACV), but not vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), in an interferon- and DROSHA-independent manner (PubMed:25126784). Binds to RVFV RNA, likely via structured viral RNA elements (PubMed:25126784).

Also, plays a role in regulation of processes including cell migration, cell proliferation, cell contraction and cell adhesion. Regulates transepithelial migration of neutrophils into the alveolar lumen, potentially via mediation of cell surface expression of adhesion markers and lipid raft formation (By similarity). Negatively regulates caveolae formation by reducing CAV1 expression and CAV1 amount by increasing lysosomal degradation (PubMed:24814193). Facilitates surface trafficking and formation of lipid rafts bearing GPI-anchor proteins (By similarity). Regulates surface expression of MHC1 and ICAM1 proteins increasing susceptibility to T-cell mediated cytotoxicity (By similarity). Regulates the plasma membrane expression of the integrin heterodimers ITGA6-ITGB1, ITGA5-ITGB3 and ITGA5-ITGB1 resulting in modulation of cell-matrix adhesion (PubMed:16216233). Also regulates many processes through PTK2. Regulates blood vessel endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis by regulating VEGF protein expression through PTK2 activation (PubMed:23439602). Regulates cell migration and cell contraction through PTK2 and SRC activation (PubMed:21637765, PubMed:22728127). Regulates focal adhesion density, F-actin conformation and cell adhesion capacity through interaction with PTK2 (PubMed:19494199). Positively regulates cell proliferation (PubMed:24814193). Plays a role during cell death and cell blebbing (PubMed:12107182). Promotes angiogenesis and vasculogenesis through induction of VEGFA via a HIF1A-dependent pathway (PubMed:23334331). Also plays a role in embryo implantation by regulating surface trafficking of integrin heterodimer ITGA5-ITGB3 (PubMed:16487956). Plays a role in placental angiogenesis and uterine natural killer cell regulation at the maternal-fetal placental interface, however not required in the maternal tissues for a viable pregnancy (By similarity). Involved in the early stages of embryogenic development and cardiogenesis, potentially via regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition timing (By similarity). May play a role in glomerular filtration (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:F1QIK8, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O88662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107182, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16216233, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16487956, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19494199, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21637765, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22728127, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23334331, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23439602, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24814193}.","EMP2","apical part of cell [GO:0045177]; apical plasma membrane [GO:0016324]; cell surface [GO:0009986]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytoplasmic vesicle [GO:0031410]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; Golgi apparatus [GO:0005794]; Golgi membrane [GO:0000139]; integral component of membrane [GO:0016021]; membrane raft [GO:0045121]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; integrin binding [GO:0005178]; kinase binding [GO:0019900]; protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]; actin filament organization [GO:0007015]; actin-mediated cell contraction [GO:0070252]; activation of protein kinase activity [GO:0032147]; bleb assembly [GO:0032060]; blood vessel endothelial cell migration [GO:0043534]; cell adhesion [GO:0007155]; cell death [GO:0008219]; cell migration [GO:0016477]; cell-matrix adhesion [GO:0007160]; early endosome to late endosome transport [GO:0045022]; embryo implantation [GO:0007566]; embryonic process involved in female pregnancy [GO:0060136]; heart formation [GO:0060914]; membrane raft assembly [GO:0001765]; natural killer cell proliferation [GO:0001787]; neutrophil migration [GO:1990266]; plasma membrane raft assembly [GO:0044854]; positive regulation of angiogenesis [GO:0045766]; positive regulation of cardiac epithelial to mesenchymal transition [GO:0062043]; positive regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0008284]; positive regulation of cell-matrix adhesion [GO:0001954]; positive regulation of integrin-mediated signaling pathway [GO:2001046]; protein localization to cell surface [GO:0034394]; protein localization to plasma membrane [GO:0072659]; regulation of angiogenesis [GO:0045765]; regulation of cell-matrix adhesion [GO:0001952]; regulation of endothelial cell migration [GO:0010594]; regulation of glomerular filtration [GO:0003093]; regulation of kinase activity [GO:0043549]; regulation of vasculogenesis [GO:2001212]; T cell mediated cytotoxicity [GO:0001913]","","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18400107}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000255}.

Histone deacetylation gives a tag for epigenetic repression and plays an important role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression and developmental events (PubMed:16762839, PubMed:17704056). Histone deacetylases act via the formation of large multiprotein complexes (PubMed:16762839, PubMed:17704056). Also functions as deacetylase for non-histone targets, such as NR1D2, RELA, SP1, SP3 and TSHZ3 (PubMed:12837748, PubMed:16478997, PubMed:17996965, PubMed:19343227). Deacetylates SP proteins, SP1 and SP3, and regulates their function (PubMed:12837748, PubMed:16478997). Component of the BRG1-RB1-HDAC1 complex, which negatively regulates the CREST-mediated transcription in resting neurons (PubMed:19081374). Upon calcium stimulation, HDAC1 is released from the complex and CREBBP is recruited, which facilitates transcriptional activation (PubMed:19081374). Deacetylates TSHZ3 and regulates its transcriptional repressor activity (PubMed:19343227). Deacetylates 'Lys-310' in RELA and thereby inhibits the transcriptional activity of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:17000776). Deacetylates NR1D2 and abrogates the effect of KAT5-mediated relieving of NR1D2 transcription repression activity (PubMed:17996965). Component of a RCOR/GFI/KDM1A/HDAC complex that suppresses, via histone deacetylase (HDAC) recruitment, a number of genes implicated in multilineage blood cell development (By similarity). Involved in CIART-mediated transcriptional repression of the circadian transcriptional activator: CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer (By similarity). Required for the transcriptional repression of circadian target genes, such as PER1, mediated by the large PER complex or CRY1 through histone deacetylation (By similarity). In addition to protein deacetylase activity, also has protein-lysine deacylase activity: acts as a protein decrotonylase by mediating decrotonylation ((2E)-butenoyl) of histones (PubMed:28497810). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O09106, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12837748, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16478997, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16762839, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17000776, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17704056, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17996965, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19081374, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19343227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28497810}.","HDAC1","chromatin [GO:0000785]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; heterochromatin [GO:0000792]; histone deacetylase complex [GO:0000118]; neuronal cell body [GO:0043025]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; NuRD complex [GO:0016581]; protein-containing complex [GO:0032991]; Sin3 complex [GO:0016580]; transcription repressor complex [GO:0017053]; core promoter sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0001046]; deacetylase activity [GO:0019213]; DNA-binding transcription factor binding [GO:0140297]; E-box binding [GO:0070888]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; histone deacetylase activity [GO:0004407]; histone deacetylase binding [GO:0042826]; histone decrotonylase activity [GO:0160009]; Krueppel-associated box domain binding [GO:0035851]; NF-kappaB binding [GO:0051059]; p53 binding [GO:0002039]; promoter-specific chromatin binding [GO:1990841]; protein lysine deacetylase activity [GO:0033558]; protein N-terminus binding [GO:0047485]; RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0000978]; RNA polymerase II core promoter sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0000979]; RNA polymerase II-specific DNA-binding transcription factor binding [GO:0061629]; transcription corepressor activity [GO:0003714]; transcription corepressor binding [GO:0001222]; cellular response to platelet-derived growth factor stimulus [GO:0036120]; chromatin organization [GO:0006325]; chromatin remodeling [GO:0006338]; circadian regulation of gene expression [GO:0032922]; DNA methylation-dependent heterochromatin assembly [GO:0006346]; embryonic digit morphogenesis [GO:0042733]; endoderm development [GO:0007492]; epidermal cell differentiation [GO:0009913]; eyelid development in camera-type eye [GO:0061029]; fungiform papilla formation [GO:0061198]; hair follicle placode formation [GO:0060789]; hippocampus development [GO:0021766]; histone deacetylation [GO:0016575]; histone H3 deacetylation [GO:0070932]; histone H4 deacetylation [GO:0070933]; negative regulation by host of viral transcription [GO:0043922]; negative regulation of androgen receptor signaling pathway [GO:0060766]; negative regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043066]; negative regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway [GO:0090090]; negative regulation of cell migration [GO:0030336]; negative regulation of DNA-templated transcription [GO:0045892]; negative regulation of gene expression [GO:0010629]; negative regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling [GO:0043124]; negative regulation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:2001243]; negative regulation of stem cell population maintenance [GO:1902455]; negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0000122]; negative regulation of transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway [GO:0030512]; neuron differentiation [GO:0030182]; odontogenesis of dentin-containing tooth [GO:0042475]; oligodendrocyte differentiation [GO:0048709]; positive regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0008284]; positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription [GO:0045893]; positive regulation of gene expression [GO:0010628]; positive regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation [GO:0048714]; positive regulation of signaling receptor activity [GO:2000273]; positive regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation [GO:0048661]; positive regulation of stem cell population maintenance [GO:1902459]; positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0045944]; protein deacetylation [GO:0006476]; regulation of amyloid-beta clearance [GO:1900221]; regulation of cell fate specification [GO:0042659]; regulation of endopeptidase activity [GO:0052548]; regulation of stem cell differentiation [GO:2000736]; regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0006357]","Q14865; Q9C0K0; Q9HCU9; Q6PH81; Q14839; P68400; Q9UER7; Q92841-4; P17844; Q9UJW3; Q01094; Q66K89; Q96KQ7; Q96D98; Q99684; Q13227; P62805; P51610; Q92769; P43355; Q9UIS9; O95983; Q8N108; Q13330; O94776; Q9Y618; P19838; P06748; Q15466; Q9NQX1; Q96N64; P06400; Q09028; Q16576; Q9UKL0; Q04206; O00422; Q96ST3; Q9NP50; O95863; P08047; O43463; P04637; Q05516; O95365; Q92618; P29128","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10846170}.","ENST00000373548.8;",0.00504274115162958

Integrin alpha-IIb/beta-3 (ITGA2B:ITGB3) is a receptor for fibronectin, fibrinogen, plasminogen, prothrombin, thrombospondin and vitronectin. Integrins alpha-IIb/beta-3 and alpha-V/beta-3 recognize the sequence R-G-D in a wide array of ligands. Integrin alpha-IIb/beta-3 recognizes the sequence H-H-L-G-G-G-A-K-Q-A-G-D-V in fibrinogen gamma chain. Following activation integrin alpha-IIb/beta-3 brings about platelet/platelet interaction through binding of soluble fibrinogen. This step leads to rapid platelet aggregation which physically plugs ruptured endothelial surface. Fibrinogen binding enhances SELP expression in activated platelets (By similarity). ITGAV:ITGB3 binds to fractalkine (CX3CL1) and acts as its coreceptor in CX3CR1-dependent fractalkine signaling (PubMed:23125415, PubMed:24789099). ITGAV:ITGB3 binds to NRG1 (via EGF domain) and this binding is essential for NRG1-ERBB signaling (PubMed:20682778). ITGAV:ITGB3 binds to FGF1 and this binding is essential for FGF1 signaling (PubMed:18441324). ITGAV:ITGB3 binds to FGF2 and this binding is essential for FGF2 signaling (PubMed:28302677). ITGAV:ITGB3 binds to IGF1 and this binding is essential for IGF1 signaling (PubMed:19578119). ITGAV:ITGB3 binds to IGF2 and this binding is essential for IGF2 signaling (PubMed:28873464). ITGAV:ITGB3 binds to IL1B and this binding is essential for IL1B signaling (PubMed:29030430). ITGAV:ITGB3 binds to PLA2G2A via a site (site 2) which is distinct from the classical ligand-binding site (site 1) and this induces integrin conformational changes and enhanced ligand binding to site 1 (PubMed:18635536, PubMed:25398877). ITGAV:ITGB3 acts as a receptor for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) and mediates R-G-D-dependent cell adhesion to FBN1 (PubMed:12807887). In brain, plays a role in synaptic transmission and plasticity. Involved in the regulation of the serotonin neurotransmission, is required to localize to specific compartments within the synapse the serotonin receptor SLC6A4 and for an appropriate reuptake of serotonin. Controls excitatory synaptic strength by regulating GRIA2-containing AMPAR endocytosis, which affects AMPAR abundance and composition (By similarity).

The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10523667}.","KPNA6","cytosol [GO:0005829]; host cell [GO:0043657]; membrane [GO:0016020]; NLS-dependent protein nuclear import complex [GO:0042564]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; nuclear import signal receptor activity [GO:0061608]; nuclear localization sequence binding [GO:0008139]; entry of viral genome into host nucleus through nuclear pore complex via importin [GO:0075506]; maternal process involved in female pregnancy [GO:0060135]; NLS-bearing protein import into nucleus [GO:0006607]; positive regulation of cytokine production involved in inflammatory response [GO:1900017]; positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0045944]; positive regulation of viral life cycle [GO:1903902]; transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0006366]; viral genome replication [GO:0019079]","X5D778; Q92688; Q96C86; Q86YD7; O14893; P01583; Q14653; O75564-2; Q92993; Q14974; P20700; Q9Y5V3; Q9HAN9; P46087; Q9UKX7; Q9BUI4; Q96HA1-2; P78424; O43148; Q15637; Q16594; P03466; P31345; Q05322","","ENST00000373625.8;",0.00870962779989851

Upon binding to R-spondins (RSPO1, RSPO2, RSPO3 or RSPO4), associates with phosphorylated LRP6 and frizzled receptors that are activated by extracellular Wnt receptors, triggering the canonical Wnt signaling pathway to increase expression of target genes. In contrast to classical G-protein coupled receptors, does not activate heterotrimeric G-proteins to transduce the signal. Its function as activator of the Wnt signaling pathway is required for the development of various organs, including liver, kidney, intestine, bone, reproductive tract and eye. May also act as a receptor for norrin (NDP), such results however require additional confirmation in vivo. Required during spermatogenesis to activate the Wnt signaling pathway in peritubular myoid cells. Required for the maintenance of intestinal stem cells and Paneth cell differentiation in postnatal intestinal crypts. Acts as a regulator of bone formation and remodeling. Involved in kidney development; required for maintaining the ureteric bud in an undifferentiated state. Involved in the development of the anterior segment of the eye. Required during erythropoiesis.

Especially, MAP2K3/MKK3 and MAP2K6/MKK6 are both essential for the activation of MAPK11 and MAPK13 induced by environmental stress, whereas MAP2K6/MKK6 is the major MAPK11 activator in response to TNF. MAP2K6/MKK6 also phosphorylates and activates PAK6. The p38 MAP kinase signal transduction pathway leads to direct activation of transcription factors. Nuclear targets of p38 MAP kinase include the transcription factors ATF2 and ELK1. Within the p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway, MAP3K6/MKK6 mediates phosphorylation of STAT4 through MAPK14 activation, and is therefore required for STAT4 activation and STAT4-regulated gene expression in response to IL-12 stimulation. The pathway is also crucial for IL-6-induced SOCS3 expression and down-regulation of IL-6-mediated gene induction; and for IFNG-dependent gene transcription. Has a role in osteoclast differentiation through NF-kappa-B transactivation by TNFSF11, and in endochondral ossification and since SOX9 is another likely downstream target of the p38 MAPK pathway. MAP2K6/MKK6 mediates apoptotic cell death in thymocytes. Acts also as a regulator for melanocytes dendricity, through the modulation of Rho family GTPases. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10961885, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11727828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15550393, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20869211, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8622669, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8626699, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8663074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9218798}.","MAP2K6","cytoskeleton [GO:0005856]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; MAP kinase kinase activity [GO:0004708]; phosphatase activator activity [GO:0019211]; protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity [GO:0043539]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004713]; apoptotic process [GO:0006915]; bone development [GO:0060348]; cardiac muscle contraction [GO:0060048]; cellular response to sorbitol [GO:0072709]; cellular senescence [GO:0090398]; DNA damage induced protein phosphorylation [GO:0006975]; MAPK cascade [GO:0000165]; negative regulation of cold-induced thermogenesis [GO:0120163]; nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing signaling pathway [GO:0070423]; osteoblast differentiation [GO:0001649]; ovulation cycle process [GO:0022602]; p38MAPK cascade [GO:0038066]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of MAP kinase activity [GO:0043406]; positive regulation of nitric-oxide synthase biosynthetic process [GO:0051770]; positive regulation of prostaglandin secretion [GO:0032308]; regulation of cell cycle [GO:0051726]; regulation of signal transduction by p53 class mediator [GO:1901796]; response to ischemia [GO:0002931]; response to xenobiotic stimulus [GO:0009410]; signal transduction [GO:0007165]; stress-activated MAPK cascade [GO:0051403]","Q5S007; Q16539; Q16236; Q9NRD5; O76024; P52564-1","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9768359}.

Acts as mitochondria-specific NDK; its association with cardiolipin-containing mitochondrial inner membrane is coupled to respiration suggesting that ADP locally regenerated in the mitochondrion innermembrane space by its activity is directly taken up via ANT ADP/ATP translocase into the matrix space to stimulate respiratory ATP regeneration (PubMed:18635542). Proposed to increase GTP-loading on dynamin-related GTPase OPA1 in mitochondria (PubMed:24970086). In vitro can induce liposome cross-linking suggesting that it can cross-link inner and outer membranes to form contact sites, and promotes intermembrane migration of anionic phosphoplipids. Promotes the redistribution of cardiolipin between the mitochondrial inner membrane and outer membrane which is implicated in pro-apoptotic signaling (PubMed:18635542, PubMed:17028143, PubMed:23150663). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10799505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17028143, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18635542, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23150663, ECO:0000305, ECO:0000305|PubMed:24970086}.","NME4","mitochondrial inner membrane [GO:0005743]; mitochondrial intermembrane space [GO:0005758]; mitochondrial matrix [GO:0005759]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; cardiolipin binding [GO:1901612]; metal ion binding [GO:0046872]; nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity [GO:0004550]; CTP biosynthetic process [GO:0006241]; GTP biosynthetic process [GO:0006183]; lipid transport [GO:0006869]; nucleoside diphosphate phosphorylation [GO:0006165]; nucleoside metabolic process [GO:0009116]; UTP biosynthetic process [GO:0006228]","Q9NYB9-2; P01019; Q9H6L4; Q8N5M1; P54253; Q8WUW1; Q9NWQ9; Q9NX04; Q9NPB3; Q9NP86; Q68D86; Q2TAC2-2; P55273; Q8IYR0; Q99828; Q96Q77; Q9UHD4; Q86UW9; P02042; Q8WUI4-6; O75031; P42858; P03952; P61968; P06858; Q13064; P40692; P15531; P22392; Q9Y5B8; P61970; Q9UBU9; Q9BY11; O15160; P20618; P37840; Q9NZD8; Q9UMX1; Q13148; O14656-2; P0DI81-3; Q15645; Q96PN8; Q6DKK2; Q9BZL1; P40337-2; Q05516","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion intermembrane space {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18635542}; Peripheral membrane protein.

Binds the conventional octamer sequence in double-stranded DNA (PubMed:11525732, PubMed:12403470, PubMed:26571461). Also binds single-stranded DNA and RNA at a site independent of the duplex site (PubMed:11525732, PubMed:12403470, PubMed:26571461). Involved in pre-mRNA splicing, probably as a heterodimer with SFPQ (PubMed:11525732, PubMed:12403470, PubMed:26571461). Interacts with U5 snRNA, probably by binding to a purine-rich sequence located on the 3' side of U5 snRNA stem 1b (PubMed:12403470). Together with PSPC1, required for the formation of nuclear paraspeckles (PubMed:22416126). The SFPQ-NONO heteromer associated with MATR3 may play a role in nuclear retention of defective RNAs (PubMed:11525732). The SFPQ-NONO heteromer may be involved in DNA unwinding by modulating the function of topoisomerase I/TOP1 (PubMed:10858305). The SFPQ-NONO heteromer may be involved in DNA non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) required for double-strand break repair and V(D)J recombination and may stabilize paired DNA ends (PubMed:15590677). In vitro, the complex strongly stimulates DNA end joining, binds directly to the DNA substrates and cooperates with the Ku70/G22P1-Ku80/XRCC5 (Ku) dimer to establish a functional preligation complex (PubMed:15590677). NONO is involved in transcriptional regulation. The SFPQ-NONO-NR5A1 complex binds to the CYP17 promoter and regulates basal and cAMP-dependent transcriptional activity (PubMed:11897684). NONO binds to an enhancer element in long terminal repeats of endogenous intracisternal A particles (IAPs) and activates transcription (By similarity). Regulates the circadian clock by repressing the transcriptional activator activity of the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer (By similarity). Important for the functional organization of GABAergic synapses (By similarity). Plays a specific and important role in the regulation of synaptic RNAs and GPHN/gephyrin scaffold structure, through the regulation of GABRA2 transcript (By similarity). Plays a key role during neuronal differentiation by recruiting TET1 to genomic loci and thereby regulating 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels (By similarity). Plays a role in the regulation of DNA virus-mediated innate immune response by assembling into the HDP-RNP complex, a complex that serves as a platform for IRF3 phosphorylation and subsequent innate immune response activation through the cGAS-STING pathway (PubMed:28712728, PubMed:30270045). Promotes activation of the cGAS-STING pathway in response to HIV-2 infection: acts by interacting with HIV-2 Capsid protein p24, thereby promoting detection of viral DNA by CGAS, leading to CGAS-mediated inmmune activation (PubMed:30270045). In contrast, the weak interaction with HIV-1 Capsid protein p24 does not allow activation of the cGAS-STING pathway (PubMed:30270045). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q99K48, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10858305, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11525732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11897684, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12403470, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15590677, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22416126, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26571461, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28712728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30270045}.","NONO","chromosome [GO:0005694]; fibrillar center [GO:0001650]; membrane [GO:0016020]; nuclear matrix [GO:0016363]; nuclear speck [GO:0016607]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; paraspeckles [GO:0042382]; RNA polymerase II transcription regulator complex [GO:0090575]; chromatin binding [GO:0003682]; DNA binding [GO:0003677]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; RNA binding [GO:0003723]; activation of innate immune response [GO:0002218]; circadian rhythm [GO:0007623]; DNA recombination [GO:0006310]; DNA repair [GO:0006281]; innate immune response [GO:0045087]; mRNA processing [GO:0006397]; negative regulation of DNA-templated transcription [GO:0045892]; negative regulation of oxidative stress-induced neuron intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:1903377]; regulation of circadian rhythm [GO:0042752]; regulation of DNA-templated transcription [GO:0006355]; RNA splicing [GO:0008380]","Q9H3H3; Q9H3H3-3; Q53ET0; P51114; Q15233; Q13526; Q8WXF1; Q8WXF1-1; Q8WXF1-2; P23246; Q8AZK7; P26196; P61968; Q13526; P54646; Q8WXF1","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22416126, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28712728}.

Acts as a regulator of cellular senescence and cellular ploidy by mediating phosphorylation of 'Ser-464' of LATS1, thereby controlling its stability. Controls cell adhesion by regulating activity of the myosin protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex. Acts by mediating phosphorylation of PPP1R12A subunit of myosin PP1: phosphorylated PPP1R12A then interacts with 14-3-3, leading to reduced dephosphorylation of myosin MLC2 by myosin PP1. May be involved in DNA damage response: phosphorylates p53/TP53 at 'Ser-15' and 'Ser-392' and is recruited to the CDKN1A/WAF1 promoter to participate in transcription activation by p53/TP53. May also act as a tumor malignancy-associated factor by promoting tumor invasion and metastasis under regulation and phosphorylation by AKT1. Suppresses Fas-induced apoptosis by mediating phosphorylation of CASP6, thereby suppressing the activation of the caspase and the subsequent cleavage of CFLAR.

Hydrolyzes phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine and probably phosphatidylinositol with a possible preference for the former (PubMed:15695510). Has also a broad substrate specificity in terms of fatty acid moieties, hydrolyzing saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids at nearly equal rates from either the sn-1 or sn-2 position in diacyl phosphatidylcholine (PubMed:10833412, PubMed:10744668, PubMed:15695510, PubMed:15908428).

On the other hand, can produce arachidonic acid from the sn-1 position of diacyl phospholipid and from the sn-2 position of arachidonate-containing plasmalogen substrates (PubMed:15908428). Therefore, plays an important role in the mobilization of arachidonic acid in response to cellular stimuli and the generation of lipid second messengers (PubMed:15695510, PubMed:15908428).

Involved in cell proliferation and cell growth arrest by positive and negative regulation of the cell cycle. Can promote cell growth by phosphorylating and activating RAF1, which mediates the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade, and/or by up-regulating CDKN1A, which facilitates active cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex formation in glioma cells. In intestinal cells stimulated by the phorbol ester PMA, can trigger a cell cycle arrest program which is associated with the accumulation of the hyper-phosphorylated growth-suppressive form of RB1 and induction of the CDK inhibitors CDKN1A and CDKN1B. Exhibits anti-apoptotic function in glioma cells and protects them from apoptosis by suppressing the p53/TP53-mediated activation of IGFBP3, and in leukemia cells mediates anti-apoptotic action by phosphorylating BCL2. During macrophage differentiation induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1), is translocated to the nucleus and is associated with macrophage development. After wounding, translocates from focal contacts to lamellipodia and participates in the modulation of desmosomal adhesion. Plays a role in cell motility by phosphorylating CSPG4, which induces association of CSPG4 with extensive lamellipodia at the cell periphery and polarization of the cell accompanied by increases in cell motility. During chemokine-induced CD4(+) T cell migration, phosphorylates CDC42-guanine exchange factor DOCK8 resulting in its dissociation from LRCH1 and the activation of GTPase CDC42 (PubMed:28028151). Is highly expressed in a number of cancer cells where it can act as a tumor promoter and is implicated in malignant phenotypes of several tumors such as gliomas and breast cancers. Negatively regulates myocardial contractility and positively regulates angiogenesis, platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in arteries. Mediates hypertrophic growth of neonatal cardiomyocytes, in part through a MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2)-dependent signaling pathway, and upon PMA treatment, is required to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy up to heart failure and death, by increasing protein synthesis, protein-DNA ratio and cell surface area. Regulates cardiomyocyte function by phosphorylating cardiac troponin T (TNNT2/CTNT), which induces significant reduction in actomyosin ATPase activity, myofilament calcium sensitivity and myocardial contractility. In angiogenesis, is required for full endothelial cell migration, adhesion to vitronectin (VTN), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)-dependent regulation of kinase activation and vascular tube formation. Involved in the stabilization of VEGFA mRNA at post-transcriptional level and mediates VEGFA-induced cell proliferation. In the regulation of calcium-induced platelet aggregation, mediates signals from the CD36/GP4 receptor for granule release, and activates the integrin heterodimer ITGA2B-ITGB3 through the RAP1GAP pathway for adhesion. During response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), may regulate selective LPS-induced macrophage functions involved in host defense and inflammation. But in some inflammatory responses, may negatively regulate NF-kappa-B-induced genes, through IL1A-dependent induction of NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA/IKBA). Upon stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), phosphorylates EIF4G1, which modulates EIF4G1 binding to MKNK1 and may be involved in the regulation of EIF4E phosphorylation. Phosphorylates KIT, leading to inhibition of KIT activity. Phosphorylates ATF2 which promotes cooperation between ATF2 and JUN, activating transcription. Phosphorylates SOCS2 at 'Ser-52' facilitating its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P20444, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10848585, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11909826, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12724315, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12832403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15016832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15504744, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15526160, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18056764, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19176525, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21576361, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23990668, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28028151, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9738012, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9830023, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9873035, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9927633}.","PRKCA","alphav-beta3 integrin-PKCalpha complex [GO:0035866]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; mitochondrial membrane [GO:0031966]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:0048471]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; calcium-dependent protein kinase C activity [GO:0004698]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; histone kinase activity (H3-T6 specific) [GO:0035403]; integrin binding [GO:0005178]; protein kinase activity [GO:0004672]; protein kinase C activity [GO:0004697]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]; angiogenesis [GO:0001525]; apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:0097190]; cell adhesion [GO:0007155]; desmosome assembly [GO:0002159]; intracellular signal transduction [GO:0035556]; mitotic nuclear membrane disassembly [GO:0007077]; negative regulation of glial cell apoptotic process [GO:0034351]; peptidyl-serine phosphorylation [GO:0018105]; peptidyl-threonine phosphorylation [GO:0018107]; positive regulation of adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway [GO:0106071]; positive regulation of angiogenesis [GO:0045766]; positive regulation of blood vessel endothelial cell migration [GO:0043536]; positive regulation of bone resorption [GO:0045780]; positive regulation of cardiac muscle hypertrophy [GO:0010613]; positive regulation of cell adhesion [GO:0045785]; positive regulation of cell migration [GO:0030335]; positive regulation of dense core granule biogenesis [GO:2000707]; positive regulation of endothelial cell migration [GO:0010595]; positive regulation of endothelial cell proliferation [GO:0001938]; positive regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade [GO:0070374]; positive regulation of lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0031666]; positive regulation of macrophage differentiation [GO:0045651]; positive regulation of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0045931]; post-translational protein modification [GO:0043687]; protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]; regulation of mRNA stability [GO:0043488]; regulation of platelet aggregation [GO:0090330]; response to interleukin-1 [GO:0070555]","Q15027; Q06481-5; Q66PJ3-4; Q13072; Q8N9N5-2; Q96A33; Q96LY2-2; P15169; P43234; O95424; O43598; P21728; P00533; P60228; Q96J88-3; Q8IVH2-2; Q96NE9-2; O14926; Q06547-3; P19440-3; Q9UJ42; P62805; Q9UBN7; P52597; Q92826; Q02363; Q96FT9-2; P17936; P26951; Q9BYR8; Q9Y234; P51884; Q9H213; P80192; Q15759; A0JLT2-2; Q9H8H3; Q8N983-3; P49821; Q2M1J6; Q9BRX2; Q9Y6X2; P11309-2; Q6P1J6-2; Q9UNA4; Q02156; P07225; Q3YEC7-3; O94844; Q9NWS8-3; Q9ULK6-3; P18077; P31431; Q99643; Q14141; Q01105-2; P37840; Q9Y5X0; P56693; Q9BRW5; O43761; P15884; Q3YBM2; P0CG48; P13051-2; Q8NB14; O95498; Q9NZC7-5; Q9BQ24; Q05CR2; Q8N0Y2-2; O15535; Q24008","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23990668}.

Thereby regulates many processes like cell proliferation, cell survival, cell growth, cell differentiation and cell migration in several tissues namely neuron and bone (PubMed:1733956, PubMed:1768439, PubMed:11278720, PubMed:19141530, PubMed:27445335, PubMed:30667096, PubMed:19442624). Also plays a role in synaptic plasticity and learning-related behavior by inhibiting long-term synaptic potentiation (By similarity). Binds PTPRZ1, leading to neutralization of the negative charges of the CS chains of PTPRZ1, inducing PTPRZ1 clustering, thereby causing the dimerization and inactivation of its phosphatase activity leading to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of each of the PTPRZ1 substrates like ALK, CTNNB1 or AFAP1L2 in order to activate the PI3K-AKT pathway (PubMed:17681947, PubMed:27445335, PubMed:30667096, PubMed:16814777, PubMed:10706604). Through PTPRZ1 binding controls oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation by enhancing the phosphorylation of AFAP1L2 in order to activate the PI3K-AKT pathway (PubMed:27445335, PubMed:30667096). Forms a complex with PTPRZ1 and integrin alpha-V/beta-3 (ITGAV:ITGB3) that stimulates endothelial cell migration through SRC dephosphorylation and activation that consequently leads to ITGB3 'Tyr-773' phosphorylation (PubMed:19141530). In adult hippocampus promotes dendritic arborization, spine development, and functional integration and connectivity of newborn granule neurons through ALK by activating AKT signaling pathway (By similarity). Binds GPC2 and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) at the neuron surface, leading to abrogation of binding between PTPRS and CSPGs and neurite outgrowth promotion (By similarity). Binds SDC3 and mediates bone formation by recruiting and attaching osteoblasts/osteoblast precursors to the sites for new bone deposition (By similarity). Binds ALK and promotes cell survival and cell proliferation through MAPK pathway activation (PubMed:11278720). Inhibits proliferation and enhances differentiation of neural stem cells by inhibiting FGF2-induced fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling pathway (By similarity). Mediates regulatory mechanisms in normal hemostasis and in hematopoietic regeneration and in maintaining the balance of myeloid and lymphoid regeneration (By similarity).

Regulates protein synthesis through phosphorylation of EIF4B, RPS6 and EEF2K, and contributes to cell survival by repressing the pro-apoptotic function of BAD. Under conditions of nutrient depletion, the inactive form associates with the EIF3 translation initiation complex. Upon mitogenic stimulation, phosphorylation by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) leads to dissociation from the EIF3 complex and activation. The active form then phosphorylates and activates several substrates in the pre-initiation complex, including the EIF2B complex and the cap-binding complex component EIF4B. Also controls translation initiation by phosphorylating a negative regulator of EIF4A, PDCD4, targeting it for ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis. Promotes initiation of the pioneer round of protein synthesis by phosphorylating POLDIP3/SKAR. In response to IGF1, activates translation elongation by phosphorylating EEF2 kinase (EEF2K), which leads to its inhibition and thus activation of EEF2. Also plays a role in feedback regulation of mTORC2 by mTORC1 by phosphorylating RICTOR, resulting in the inhibition of mTORC2 and AKT1 signaling. Mediates cell survival by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic protein BAD and suppressing its pro-apoptotic function. Phosphorylates mitochondrial URI1 leading to dissociation of a URI1-PPP1CC complex. The free mitochondrial PPP1CC can then dephosphorylate RPS6KB1 at Thr-412, which is proposed to be a negative feedback mechanism for the RPS6KB1 anti-apoptotic function. Mediates TNF-alpha-induced insulin resistance by phosphorylating IRS1 at multiple serine residues, resulting in accelerated degradation of IRS1. In cells lacking functional TSC1-2 complex, constitutively phosphorylates and inhibits GSK3B. May be involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement through binding to neurabin. Phosphorylates and activates the pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme CAD, downstream of MTOR (PubMed:11500364, PubMed:12801526, PubMed:14673156, PubMed:15071500, PubMed:15341740, PubMed:16286006, PubMed:17052453, PubMed:17053147, PubMed:17936702, PubMed:18952604, PubMed:19085255, PubMed:19720745, PubMed:19935711, PubMed:19995915, PubMed:23429703).

Up-regulates Na(+) channels: SCNN1A/ENAC, SCN5A and ASIC1/ACCN2, K(+) channels: KCNJ1/ROMK1, KCNA1-5, KCNQ1-5 and KCNE1, epithelial Ca(2+) channels: TRPV5 and TRPV6, chloride channels: BSND, CLCN2 and CFTR, glutamate transporters: SLC1A3/EAAT1, SLC1A2 /EAAT2, SLC1A1/EAAT3, SLC1A6/EAAT4 and SLC1A7/EAAT5, amino acid transporters: SLC1A5/ASCT2, SLC38A1/SN1 and SLC6A19, creatine transporter: SLC6A8, Na(+)/dicarboxylate cotransporter: SLC13A2/NADC1, Na(+)-dependent phosphate cotransporter: SLC34A2/NAPI-2B, glutamate receptor: GRIK2/GLUR6. Up-regulates carriers: SLC9A3/NHE3, SLC12A1/NKCC2, SLC12A3/NCC, SLC5A3/SMIT, SLC2A1/GLUT1, SLC5A1/SGLT1 and SLC15A2/PEPT2. Regulates enzymes: GSK3A/B, PMM2 and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase, and transcription factors: CTNNB1 and nuclear factor NF-kappa-B. Stimulates sodium transport into epithelial cells by enhancing the stability and expression of SCNN1A/ENAC. This is achieved by phosphorylating the NEDD4L ubiquitin E3 ligase, promoting its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, thereby preventing it from binding to SCNN1A/ENAC and targeting it for degradation. Regulates store-operated Ca(+2) entry (SOCE) by stimulating ORAI1 and STIM1. Regulates KCNJ1/ROMK1 directly via its phosphorylation or indirectly via increased interaction with SLC9A3R2/NHERF2. Phosphorylates MDM2 and activates MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53/TP53. Phosphorylates MAPT/TAU and mediates microtubule depolymerization and neurite formation in hippocampal neurons. Phosphorylates SLC2A4/GLUT4 and up-regulates its activity. Phosphorylates APBB1/FE65 and promotes its localization to the nucleus. Phosphorylates MAPK1/ERK2 and activates it by enhancing its interaction with MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Phosphorylates FBXW7 and plays an inhibitory role in the NOTCH1 signaling. Phosphorylates FOXO1 resulting in its relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Phosphorylates FOXO3, promoting its exit from the nucleus and interference with FOXO3-dependent transcription. Phosphorylates BRAF and MAP3K3/MEKK3 and inhibits their activity. Phosphorylates SLC9A3/NHE3 in response to dexamethasone, resulting in its activation and increased localization at the cell membrane. Phosphorylates CREB1. Necessary for vascular remodeling during angiogenesis. Sustained high levels and activity may contribute to conditions such as hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Isoform 2 exhibited a greater effect on cell plasma membrane expression of SCNN1A/ENAC and Na(+) transport than isoform 1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154281, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11410590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11696533, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12397388, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12590200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12634932, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12650886, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12761204, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12911626, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14623317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14706641, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15040001, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15044175, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15234985, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15319523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15496163, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15733869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15737648, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15845389, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15888551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16036218, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16443776, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16982696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17382906, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18005662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18304449, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18753299, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19447520, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19756449, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20511718, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20730100, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21865597}.","SGK1","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endoplasmic reticulum membrane [GO:0005789]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nuclear speck [GO:0016607]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; calcium channel regulator activity [GO:0005246]; chloride channel regulator activity [GO:0017081]; potassium channel regulator activity [GO:0015459]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004712]; sodium channel regulator activity [GO:0017080]; apoptotic process [GO:0006915]; cellular response to aldosterone [GO:1904045]; cellular response to DNA damage stimulus [GO:0006974]; intracellular signal transduction [GO:0035556]; long-term memory [GO:0007616]; neuron projection morphogenesis [GO:0048812]; peptidyl-serine phosphorylation [GO:0018105]; positive regulation of transporter activity [GO:0032411]; protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]; regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0042981]; regulation of blood pressure [GO:0008217]; regulation of catalytic activity [GO:0050790]; regulation of cell growth [GO:0001558]; regulation of cell migration [GO:0030334]; regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0042127]; regulation of DNA-binding transcription factor activity [GO:0051090]; regulation of gastric acid secretion [GO:0060453]; regulation of signal transduction by p53 class mediator [GO:1901796]; renal sodium ion absorption [GO:0070294]; sodium ion transport [GO:0006814]","O15182; Q969L2; Q9ULP0-2; P49815; Q80UE6","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.

Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF).

In concert with the AP-3 complex, the BLOC-1 complex is required to target membrane protein cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals. The BLOC-1 complex, in association with SNARE proteins, is also proposed to be involved in neurite extension. Plays a role in intracellular vesicle trafficking and synaptic vesicle recycling. May modulate a step between vesicle priming, fusion and calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release through its ability to potentiate the interaction of synaptotagmin with the SNAREs and the plasma-membrane-associated protein SNAP25. Its phosphorylation state influences exocytotic protein interactions and may regulate synaptic vesicle exocytosis. May also have a role in the mechanisms of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion in non-neuronal cells (PubMed:17182842, PubMed:18167355).

Acts in part as component of the retromer membrane-deforming SNX-BAR subcomplex. The SNX-BAR retromer mediates retrograde transport of cargo proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is involved in endosome-to-plasma membrane transport for cargo protein recycling. The SNX-BAR subcomplex functions to deform the donor membrane into a tubular profile called endosome-to-TGN transport carrier (ETC) (Probable). Can sense membrane curvature and has in vitro vesicle-to-membrane remodeling activity (PubMed:19816406, PubMed:23085988). Involved in retrograde endosome-to-TGN transport of lysosomal enzyme receptors (IGF2R, M6PR and SORT1) and Shiginella dysenteria toxin stxB.

Required for protein transport from the Golgi apparatus to the lysosomes by a pathway that is independent of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR). Lysosomal proteins bind specifically to the receptor in the Golgi apparatus and the resulting receptor-ligand complex is transported to an acidic prelysosomal compartment where the low pH mediates the dissociation of the complex (PubMed:16787399). The receptor is then recycled back to the Golgi for another round of trafficking through its binding to the retromer. Also required for protein transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endosomes. Promotes neuronal apoptosis by mediating endocytosis of the proapoptotic precursor forms of BDNF (proBDNF) and NGFB (proNGFB). Also acts as a receptor for neurotensin. May promote mineralization of the extracellular matrix during osteogenic differentiation by scavenging extracellular LPL. Probably required in adipocytes for the formation of specialized storage vesicles containing the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 (GLUT4 storage vesicles, or GSVs). These vesicles provide a stable pool of SLC2A4 and confer increased responsiveness to insulin.

Also binds to some promoter regions (By similarity). Plays a central role in successive steps of chondrocyte differentiation (By similarity). Absolutely required for precartilaginous condensation, the first step in chondrogenesis during which skeletal progenitors differentiate into prechondrocytes (By similarity). Together with SOX5 and SOX6, required for overt chondrogenesis when condensed prechondrocytes differentiate into early stage chondrocytes, the second step in chondrogenesis (By similarity). Later, required to direct hypertrophic maturation and block osteoblast differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes: maintains chondrocyte columnar proliferation, delays prehypertrophy and then prevents osteoblastic differentiation of chondrocytes by lowering beta-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling and RUNX2 expression (By similarity). Also required for chondrocyte hypertrophy, both indirectly, by keeping the lineage fate of chondrocytes, and directly, by remaining present in upper hypertrophic cells and transactivating COL10A1 along with MEF2C (By similarity). Low lipid levels are the main nutritional determinant for chondrogenic commitment of skeletal progenitor cells: when lipids levels are low, FOXO (FOXO1 and FOXO3) transcription factors promote expression of SOX9, which induces chondrogenic commitment and suppresses fatty acid oxidation (By similarity). Mechanistically, helps, but is not required, to remove epigenetic signatures of transcriptional repression and deposit active promoter and enhancer marks at chondrocyte-specific genes (By similarity). Acts in cooperation with the Hedgehog pathway-dependent GLI (GLI1 and GLI3) transcription factors (By similarity). In addition to cartilage development, also acts as a regulator of proliferation and differentiation in epithelial stem/progenitor cells: involved in the lung epithelium during branching morphogenesis, by balancing proliferation and differentiation and regulating the extracellular matrix (By similarity). Controls epithelial branching during kidney development (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q04887, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24038782, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8640233}.","SOX9","chromatin [GO:0000785]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654];

Involved in many biological processes, such as bone development, angiogenesis, wound healing, cellular differentiation, chromatin modification and apoptosis (PubMed:1683874, PubMed:7935379, PubMed:9252372, PubMed:27270573). Acts as a protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase by mediating the cross-linking of proteins, such as ACO2, HSPB6, FN1, HMGB1, RAP1GDS1, SLC25A4/ANT1, SPP1 and WDR54 (PubMed:23941696, PubMed:24349085, PubMed:29618516, PubMed:30458214). Under physiological conditions, the protein cross-linking activity is inhibited by GTP; inhibition is relieved by Ca(2+) in response to various stresses (PubMed:7649299, PubMed:7592956, PubMed:18092889). When secreted, catalyzes cross-linking of proteins of the extracellular matrix, such as FN1 and SPP1 resulting in the formation of scaffolds (PubMed:12506096). Plays a key role during apoptosis, both by (1) promoting the cross-linking of cytoskeletal proteins resulting in condensation of the cytoplasm, and by (2) mediating cross-linking proteins of the extracellular matrix, resulting in the irreversible formation of scaffolds that stabilize the integrity of the dying cells before their clearance by phagocytosis, thereby preventing the leakage of harmful intracellular components (PubMed:7935379, PubMed:9252372). In addition to protein cross-linking, can use different monoamine substrates to catalyze a vast array of protein post-translational modifications: mediates aminylation of serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline or histamine into glutamine residues of target proteins to generate protein serotonylation, dopaminylation, noradrenalinylation or histaminylation, respectively (PubMed:23797785, PubMed:30867594). Mediates protein serotonylation of small GTPases during activation and aggregation of platelets, leading to constitutive activation of these GTPases (By similarity). Plays a key role in chromatin organization by mediating serotonylation and dopaminylation of histone H3 (PubMed:30867594, PubMed:32273471). Catalyzes serotonylation of 'Gln-5' of histone H3 (H3Q5ser) during serotonergic neuron differentiation, thereby facilitating transcription (PubMed:30867594). Acts as a mediator of neurotransmission-independent role of nuclear dopamine in ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons: catalyzes dopaminylation of 'Gln-5' of histone H3 (H3Q5dop), thereby regulating relapse-related transcriptional plasticity in the reward system (PubMed:32273471). Regulates vein remodeling by mediating serotonylation and subsequent inactivation of ATP2A2/SERCA2 (By similarity). Also acts as a protein deamidase by mediating the side chain deamidation of specific glutamine residues of proteins to glutamate (PubMed:9623982, PubMed:20547769). Catalyzes specific deamidation of protein gliadin, a component of wheat gluten in the diet (PubMed:9623982). May also act as an isopeptidase cleaving the previously formed cross-links (PubMed:26250429, PubMed:27131890). Also able to participate in signaling pathways independently of its acyltransferase activity: acts as a signal transducer in alpha-1 adrenergic receptor-mediated stimulation of phospholipase C-delta (PLCD) activity and is required for coupling alpha-1 adrenergic agonists to the stimulation of phosphoinositide lipid metabolism (PubMed:8943303). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08587, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P21981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12506096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1683874, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18092889, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20547769, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23797785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23941696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24349085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26250429, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27131890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29618516, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30458214, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30867594, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31991788, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32273471, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7592956, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7649299, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7935379, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8943303, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9252372, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9623982, ECO:0000303|PubMed:27270573}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 2]: Has cytotoxic activity: is able to induce apoptosis independently of its acyltransferase activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17116873}.","TGM2","chromatin [GO:0000785]; collagen-containing extracellular matrix [GO:0062023]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; extracellular matrix [GO:0031012]; focal adhesion [GO:0005925]; intrinsic component of plasma membrane [GO:0031226]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:0048471]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; calcium ion binding [GO:0005509]; GTP binding [GO:0005525]; histone dopaminyltransferase activity [GO:0120297]; histone serotonyltransferase activity [GO:0120295]; peptidase activity [GO:0008233]; peptide histaminyltransferase activity [GO:0120299]; peptide noradrenalinyltransferase activity [GO:0120298]; protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase activity [GO:0003810]; protein-glutamine glutaminase activity [GO:0050568]; apoptotic cell clearance [GO:0043277]; bone development [GO:0060348]; branching involved in salivary gland morphogenesis [GO:0060445]; cellular response to cocaine [GO:0071314]; cellular response to dopamine [GO:1903351]; cellular response to serotonin [GO:1904015]; negative regulation of endoplasmic reticulum calcium ion concentration [GO:0032471]; peptide cross-linking [GO:0018149]; phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway [GO:0007200]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of cell adhesion [GO:0045785]; positive regulation of GTPase activity [GO:0043547]; positive regulation of mitochondrial calcium ion concentration [GO:0051561]; positive regulation of neurogenesis [GO:0050769]; positive regulation of small GTPase mediated signal transduction [GO:0051057]; protein deamination [GO:0018277]; protein homooligomerization [GO:0051260]; proteolysis [GO:0006508]; regulation of apoptotic cell clearance [GO:2000425]; regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0042981]; salivary gland cavitation [GO:0060662]","Q12802; PRO_0000000092 [P05067]; PRO_0000005794 [P39060]; P02751; P08727; PRO_0000018520 [P28300]; Q04206; P40337; G5E9A7; O00429-3; P50570-2; P29692-2; Q06787-7; P04792; P42858; O60333-2; D3DTS7; P60891; Q5T160; Q8N488; Q14141; O95416; Q7Z699; O14656-2; Q86WV8; P02766; Q9NYH9; O76024","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24349085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29618516, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9575137}.

Binds to U-rich sequences immediately downstream from a 5' splice sites in a uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U snRNP)-dependent fashion, thereby modulating alternative pre-RNA splicing (PubMed:11106748, PubMed:8576255). Preferably binds to the U-rich IAS1 sequence in a U1 snRNP-dependent manner; this binding is optimal if a 5' splice site is adjacent to IAS1 (By similarity). Activates the use of heterologous 5' splice sites; the activation depends on the intron sequence downstream from the 5' splice site, with a preference for a downstream U-rich sequence (PubMed:11106748). By interacting with SNRPC/U1-C, promotes recruitment and binding of spliceosomal U1 snRNP to 5' splice sites followed by U-rich sequences, thereby facilitating atypical 5' splice site recognition by U1 snRNP (PubMed:11106748, PubMed:12486009, PubMed:17488725). Activates splicing of alternative exons with weak 5' splice sites followed by a U-rich stretch on its own pre-mRNA and on TIAR mRNA (By similarity). Acts as a modulator of alternative splicing for the apoptotic FAS receptor, thereby promoting apoptosis (PubMed:11106748, PubMed:1934064, PubMed:17488725). Binds to the 5' splice site region of FAS intron 5 to promote accumulation of transcripts that include exon 6 at the expense of transcripts in which exon 6 is skipped, thereby leading to the transcription of a membrane-bound apoptotic FAS receptor, which promotes apoptosis (PubMed:11106748, PubMed:1934064, PubMed:17488725). Binds to a conserved AU-rich cis element in COL2A1 intron 2 and modulates alternative splicing of COL2A1 exon 2 (PubMed:17580305). Also binds to the equivalent AT-rich element in COL2A1 genomic DNA, and may thereby be involved in the regulation of transcription (PubMed:17580305). Binds specifically to a polypyrimidine-rich controlling element (PCE) located between the weak 5' splice site and the intronic splicing silencer of CFTR mRNA to promote exon 9 inclusion, thereby antagonizing PTB1 and its role in exon skipping of CFTR exon 9 (PubMed:14966131). Involved in the repression of mRNA translation by binding to AU-rich elements (AREs) located in mRNA 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), including target ARE-bearing mRNAs encoding TNF and PTGS2 (By similarity). Also participates in the cellular response to environmental stress, by acting downstream of the stress-induced phosphorylation of EIF2S1/EIF2A to promote the recruitment of untranslated mRNAs to cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs), leading to stress-induced translational arrest (PubMed:10613902).

The p24 protein family is a group of transmembrane proteins that bind coat protein complex I/COPI and coat protein complex II/COPII involved in vesicular trafficking between the membranes (PubMed:10052452). Acts at the lumenal side for incorporation of secretory cargo molecules into transport vesicles and involved in vesicle coat formation at the cytoplasmic side (PubMed:20427317, PubMed:27569046). Mainly functions in the early secretory pathway and cycles between the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and Golgi, mediating cargo transport through COPI and COPII-coated vesicles (PubMed:10052452, PubMed:10852829, PubMed:12237308). In COPII vesicle-mediated anterograde transport, involved in the transport of GPI-anchored proteins by acting together with TMED2 as their cargo receptor; the function specifically implies SEC24C and SEC24D of the COPII vesicle coat and lipid raft-like microdomains of the ER (PubMed:20427317, PubMed:27569046). Recognizes GPI anchors structural remodeled in the ER by the GPI inositol-deacylase/PGAP1 and the metallophosphoesterase MPPE1/PGAP5 (By similarity). In COPI vesicle-mediated retrograde transport, involved in the biogenesis of COPI vesicles and vesicle coat recruitment (PubMed:11726511). Involved in trafficking of amyloid beta A4 protein and soluble APP-beta release (independent from the modulation of gamma-secretase activity) (PubMed:17288597). Involved in the KDELR2-mediated retrograde transport of the toxin A subunit (CTX-A-K63)together with COPI and the COOH terminus of KDELR2 (By similarity). On Golgi membranes, acts as primary receptor for ARF1-GDP, a GTP-binding protein involved in COPI-vesicle formation (PubMed:11726511). Increases coatomer-dependent GTPase-activating activity of ARFGAP2 which mediates the hydrolysis of ARF1-bound GTP and therefore modulates protein trafficking from the Golgi apparatus (PubMed:19296914). Involved in the exocytic trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors F2LR1/PAR2 (trypsin and tryspin-like enzyme receptor), OPRM1 (opioid receptor) and P2RY4 (UTD and UDP receptor) from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, thus contributing to receptor resensitization (PubMed:21219331). In addition to its cargo receptor activity, may also act as a protein channel after oligomerization, facilitating the post-translational entry of leaderless cytoplasmic cargo into the ERGIC (PubMed:32272059). Involved in the translocation into ERGIC, the vesicle entry and the secretion of leaderless cargos (lacking the secretion signal sequence), including the mature form of interleukin 1/IL-1 family members, the alpha-crystallin B chain HSPB5, the carbohydrate-binding proteins galectin-1/LGALS1 and galectin-3/LGALS3, the microtubule-associated protein Tau/MAPT, and the annexin A1/ANXA1; the translocation process is dependent on cargo protein unfolding and enhanced by chaperones HSP90AB1 and HSP90B1/GRP9 (PubMed:32272059).

Has E3 protein-ubiquitin ligase activity. During the DNA damage response, participates in an autoregulatory feedback loop with TP53. Early in response to DNA damage, ATM kinase phosphorylates TRIM24 leading to its ubiquitination and degradation. After sufficient DNA repair has occurred, TP53 activates TRIM24 transcription, ultimately leading to TRIM24-mediated TP53 ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:24820418). Plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, at least in part via its effects on p53/TP53 levels. Up-regulates ligand-dependent transcription activation by AR, GCR/NR3C1, thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and ESR1. Modulates transcription activation by retinoic acid (RA) receptors, including RARA. Plays a role in regulating retinoic acid-dependent proliferation of hepatocytes (By similarity). Participates also in innate immunity by mediating the specific 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 leading to activation of downstream signal transduction of the type I IFN pathway (PubMed:32324863). Additionally, negatively regulates NLRP3/CASP1/IL-1beta-mediated pyroptosis and cell migration probably by ubiquitinating NLRP3 (PubMed:33724611). {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16322096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21164480, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24820418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32324863, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33724611}.","TRIM24","cytosol [GO:0005829]; euchromatin [GO:0000791]; male germ cell nucleus [GO:0001673]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; perichromatin fibrils [GO:0005726]; chromatin binding [GO:0003682]; estrogen response element binding [GO:0034056]; lysine-acetylated histone binding [GO:0070577]; nuclear receptor binding [GO:0016922]; p53 binding [GO:0002039]; protein kinase activity [GO:0004672]; signaling receptor binding [GO:0005102]; transcription coactivator activity [GO:0003713]; ubiquitin protein ligase activity [GO:0061630]; zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]; calcium ion homeostasis [GO:0055074]; cellular response to estrogen stimulus [GO:0071391]; epithelial cell proliferation [GO:0050673]; negative regulation of DNA-templated transcription [GO:0045892]; negative regulation of epithelial cell proliferation [GO:0050680]; positive regulation of gene expression [GO:0010628]; protein autophosphorylation [GO:0046777]; protein catabolic process [GO:0030163]; protein ubiquitination [GO:0016567]; regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0042981]; regulation of protein stability [GO:0031647]; regulation of signal transduction by p53 class mediator [GO:1901796]; regulation of vitamin D receptor signaling pathway [GO:0070562]; transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0006366]","P03372; P04637","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21164480, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32324863}.

Part of the ubiquitin fusion degradation (UFD) pathway, a process that mediates ubiquitination of protein at their N-terminus, regardless of the presence of lysine residues in target proteins (PubMed:19028681). Acts as a key regulator of DNA damage response by acting as a suppressor of RNF168, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that promotes accumulation of 'Lys-63'-linked histone H2A and H2AX at DNA damage sites, thereby acting as a guard against excessive spreading of ubiquitinated chromatin at damaged chromosomes (PubMed:22884692). In normal cells, mediates ubiquitination and degradation of isoform p19ARF/ARF of CDKN2A, a lysine-less tumor suppressor required for p53/TP53 activation under oncogenic stress (PubMed:20208519). In cancer cells, however, isoform p19ARF/ARF and TRIP12 are located in different cell compartments, preventing isoform p19ARF/ARF ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:20208519).

Ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins is regulated by interaction with proteins such as MYC, TRADD or SMARCC1, which disrupt the interaction between TRIP12 and target proteins (PubMed:20829358).

Predominantly acts as a RNA-binding protein: binds preferentially to the 5'-[CU]CUGCG-3' RNA motif and specifically recognizes mRNA transcripts modified by C5-methylcytosine (m5C) (PubMed:19561594, PubMed:31358969). Promotes mRNA stabilization: acts by binding to m5C-containing mRNAs and recruiting the mRNA stability maintainer ELAVL1, thereby preventing mRNA decay (PubMed:10817758, PubMed:11698476, PubMed:31358969). Component of the CRD-mediated complex that promotes MYC mRNA stability (PubMed:19029303). Contributes to the regulation of translation by modulating the interaction between the mRNA and eukaryotic initiation factors (By similarity). Plays a key role in RNA composition of extracellular exosomes by defining the sorting of small non-coding RNAs, such as tRNAs, Y RNAs, Vault RNAs and miRNAs (PubMed:27559612, PubMed:29073095). Probably sorts RNAs in exosomes by recognizing and binding C5-methylcytosine (m5C)-containing RNAs (PubMed:28341602, PubMed:29073095). Acts as a key effector of epidermal progenitors by preventing epidermal progenitor senescence: acts by regulating the translation of a senescence-associated subset of cytokine mRNAs, possibly by binding to m5C-containing mRNAs (PubMed:29712925). Also involved in pre-mRNA alternative splicing regulation: binds to splice sites in pre-mRNA and regulates splice site selection (PubMed:12604611). Also able to bind DNA: regulates transcription of the multidrug resistance gene MDR1 is enhanced in presence of the APEX1 acetylated form at 'Lys-6' and 'Lys-7' (PubMed:18809583). Binds to promoters that contain a Y-box (5'-CTGATTGGCCAA-3'), such as MDR1 and HLA class II genes (PubMed:8188694, PubMed:18809583). Promotes separation of DNA strands that contain mismatches or are modified by cisplatin (PubMed:14718551). Has endonucleolytic activity and can introduce nicks or breaks into double-stranded DNA, suggesting a role in DNA repair (PubMed:14718551).
