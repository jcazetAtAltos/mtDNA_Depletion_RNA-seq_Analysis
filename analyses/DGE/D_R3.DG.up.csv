Binds to asymmetric CRE's as a heterodimer and to palindromic CRE's as a homodimer (By similarity). Core effector of the ISR, which is required for adaptation to various stress such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, amino acid starvation, mitochondrial stress or oxidative stress (PubMed:32132707). During ISR, ATF4 translation is induced via an alternative ribosome translation re-initiation mechanism in response to EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation, and stress-induced ATF4 acts as a master transcription factor of stress-responsive genes in order to promote cell recovery (PubMed:32132706, PubMed:32132707). Promotes the transcription of genes linked to amino acid sufficiency and resistance to oxidative stress to protect cells against metabolic consequences of ER oxidation (By similarity). Activates the transcription of NLRP1, possibly in concert with other factors in response to ER stress (PubMed:26086088). Activates the transcription of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) in response to amino acid deprivation or ER stress (PubMed:11960987). However, when associated with DDIT3/CHOP, the transcriptional activation of the ASNS gene is inhibited in response to amino acid deprivation (PubMed:18940792). Together with DDIT3/CHOP, mediates programmed cell death by promoting the expression of genes involved in cellular amino acid metabolic processes, mRNA translation and the terminal unfolded protein response (terminal UPR), a cellular response that elicits programmed cell death when ER stress is prolonged and unresolved (By similarity). Together with DDIT3/CHOP, activates the transcription of the IRS-regulator TRIB3 and promotes ER stress-induced neuronal cell death by regulating the expression of BBC3/PUMA in response to ER stress (PubMed:15775988). May cooperate with the UPR transcriptional regulator QRICH1 to regulate ER protein homeostasis which is critical for cell viability in response to ER stress (PubMed:33384352). In the absence of stress, ATF4 translation is at low levels and it is required for normal metabolic processes such as embryonic lens formation, fetal liver hematopoiesis, bone development and synaptic plasticity (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of osteoblast differentiation in response to phosphorylation by RPS6KA3/RSK2: phosphorylation in osteoblasts enhances transactivation activity and promotes expression of osteoblast-specific genes and post-transcriptionally regulates the synthesis of Type I collagen, the main constituent of the bone matrix (PubMed:15109498). Cooperates with FOXO1 in osteoblasts to regulate glucose homeostasis through suppression of beta-cell production and decrease in insulin production (By similarity). Activates transcription of SIRT4 (By similarity). Regulates the circadian expression of the core clock component PER2 and the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 (By similarity). Binds in a circadian time-dependent manner to the cAMP response elements (CRE) in the SLC6A4 and PER2 promoters and periodically activates the transcription of these genes (By similarity). Mainly acts as a transcriptional activator in cellular stress adaptation, but it can also act as a transcriptional repressor: acts as a regulator of synaptic plasticity by repressing transcription, thereby inhibiting induction and maintenance of long-term memory (By similarity). Regulates synaptic functions via interaction with DISC1 in neurons, which inhibits ATF4 transcription factor activity by disrupting ATF4 dimerization and DNA-binding (PubMed:31444471). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q06507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11960987, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15109498, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15775988, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16682973, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17684156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18940792, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26086088, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31444471, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32132706, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32132707, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33384352}.;

Thiol protease that cleaves a tetrapeptide after an Asp residue at position P1: catalyzes cleavage of CGAS, GSDMD and IL18 (PubMed:7797510, PubMed:15326478, PubMed:23516580, PubMed:26375003, PubMed:28314590, PubMed:32109412). Required for innate immunity to cytosolic, but not vacuolar, bacteria (By similarity). Plays a key role in NLRP3-dependent CASP1 activation and IL1B and IL18 secretion in response to non-canonical activators, such as UVB radiation, cholera enterotoxin subunit B and cytosolic LPS (PubMed:26508369, PubMed:22246630, PubMed:23516580, PubMed:24879791, PubMed:25119034, PubMed:26173988, PubMed:26174085, PubMed:25964352). Activated by direct binding to LPS without the need of an upstream sensor (PubMed:25119034). Involved in NLRP6 inflammasome-dependent activation in response to lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a cell-wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, which leads to CASP1 activation and IL1B and IL18 secretion (PubMed:33377178). Independently of NLRP3 inflammasome and CASP1, promotes pyroptosis, through GSDMD cleavage and activation, followed by IL1A, IL18 and HMGB1 release in response to non-canonical inflammasome activators (PubMed:26375003, PubMed:32109412). Plays a crucial role in the restriction of Salmonella typhimurium replication in colonic epithelial cells during infection: in later stages of the infection, LPS from cytosolic Salmonella triggers CASP4 activation, which catalyzes cleavage of GSDMD, resulting in pyroptosis of infected cells and their extrusion into the gut lumen, as well as in IL18 secretion (PubMed:25121752, PubMed:26375003, PubMed:25964352, PubMed:34671164, PubMed:32109412). Cleavage of GSDMD is not strictly dependent on the consensus cleavage site but depends on an exosite interface on CASP4 that recognizes and binds the Gasdermin-D, C-terminal (GSDMD-CT) part (PubMed:32109412). Pyroptosis limits bacterial replication, while cytokine secretion promotes the recruitment and activation of immune cells and triggers mucosal inflammation (PubMed:25121752, PubMed:26375003, PubMed:25964352). Involved in LPS-induced IL6 secretion; this activity may not require caspase enzymatic activity (PubMed:26508369). Involved in cell death induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress and by treatment with cytotoxic APP peptides found in Alzheimer's patient brains (PubMed:23661706, PubMed:15123740, PubMed:22246630). Catalyzes cleavage and maturation of IL18 (PubMed:15326478). In contrast, it does not directly process IL1B (PubMed:7743998, PubMed:7797592, PubMed:7797510).

The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the terminal stages of cytokinesis and the budding of enveloped viruses (HIV-1 and other lentiviruses). Key component of the cytokinesis checkpoint, a process required to delay abscission to prevent both premature resolution of intercellular chromosome bridges and accumulation of DNA damage: upon phosphorylation by AURKB, together with ZFYVE19/ANCHR, retains abscission-competent VPS4 (VPS4A and/or VPS4B) at the midbody ring until abscission checkpoint signaling is terminated at late cytokinesis. Deactivation of AURKB results in dephosphorylation of CHMP4C followed by its dissociation from ANCHR and VPS4 and subsequent abscission (PubMed:22422861, PubMed:24814515). ESCRT-III proteins are believed to mediate the necessary vesicle extrusion and/or membrane fission activities, possibly in conjunction with the AAA ATPase VPS4. Involved in HIV-1 p6- and p9-dependent virus release. CHMP4A/B/C are required for the exosomal release of SDCBP, CD63 and syndecan (PubMed:22660413). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14505569, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14505570, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14519844, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22422861, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22660413, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24814515}.","CHMP4C","amphisome membrane [GO:1904930]; autophagosome membrane [GO:0000421]; cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane [GO:0009898]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; ESCRT III complex [GO:0000815]; Flemming body [GO:0090543]; kinetochore [GO:0000776]; kinetochore microtubule [GO:0005828]; lysosomal membrane [GO:0005765]; midbody [GO:0030496]; multivesicular body [GO:0005771]; multivesicular body membrane [GO:0032585]; nuclear pore [GO:0005643]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; protein homodimerization activity [GO:0042803]; abscission [GO:0009838]; autophagosome maturation [GO:0097352]; autophagy [GO:0006914]; late endosome to lysosome transport [GO:1902774]; late endosome to vacuole transport via multivesicular body sorting pathway [GO:0032511]; macroautophagy [GO:0016236]; membrane fission [GO:0090148]; midbody abscission [GO:0061952]; mitotic cytokinesis checkpoint signaling [GO:0044878]; mitotic metaphase plate congression [GO:0007080]; multivesicular body assembly [GO:0036258]; multivesicular body sorting pathway [GO:0071985]; multivesicular body-lysosome fusion [GO:0061763]; negative regulation of cell death [GO:0060548]; negative regulation of cytokinesis [GO:0032466]; nuclear membrane reassembly [GO:0031468]; nucleus organization [GO:0006997]; plasma membrane repair [GO:0001778]; protein transport [GO:0015031]; regulation of centrosome duplication [GO:0010824]; regulation of mitotic spindle assembly [GO:1901673]; ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process via the multivesicular body sorting pathway [GO:0043162]; ubiquitin-independent protein catabolic process via the multivesicular body sorting pathway [GO:0090611]; vesicle budding from membrane [GO:0006900]; vesicle fusion with vacuole [GO:0051469]; viral budding from plasma membrane [GO:0046761]; viral budding via host ESCRT complex [GO:0039702]","Q8WUM4; P40818","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol.

Part of the L-cysteine derived from the trans-sulfuration pathway is utilized for biosynthesis of the ubiquitous antioxidant glutathione (PubMed:18476726). Besides its role in the conversion of L-cystathionine into L-cysteine, it utilizes L-cysteine and L-homocysteine as substrates (at much lower rates than L,L-cystathionine) to produce the endogenous gaseous signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (PubMed:10212249, PubMed:19261609, PubMed:19961860, PubMed:19019829). In vitro, it converts two L-cysteine molecules into lanthionine and H2S, also two L-homocysteine molecules to homolanthionine and H2S, which can be particularly relevant under conditions of severe hyperhomocysteinemia (which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease) (PubMed:19261609). Lanthionine and homolanthionine are structural homologs of L,L-cystathionine that differ by the absence or presence of an extra methylene group, respectively (PubMed:19261609). Acts as a cysteine-protein sulfhydrase by mediating sulfhydration of target proteins: sulfhydration consists of converting -SH groups into -SSH on specific cysteine residues of target proteins such as GAPDH, PTPN1 and NF-kappa-B subunit RELA, thereby regulating their function (PubMed:22169477). By generating the gasotransmitter H2S, it participates in a number of physiological processes such as vasodilation, bone protection, and inflammation (Probable) (PubMed:29254196). Plays an essential role in myogenesis by contributing to the biogenesis of H2S in skeletal muscle tissue (By similarity). Can also accept homoserine as substrate (By similarity). Catalyzes the elimination of selenocystathionine (which can be derived from the diet) to yield selenocysteine, ammonia and 2-oxobutanoate (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P18757, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8VCN5, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10212249, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18476726, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19019829, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19261609, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19961860, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22169477, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29254196, ECO:0000303|PubMed:18476726, ECO:0000305|PubMed:18476726, ECO:0000305|PubMed:19019829}.","CTH","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; calmodulin binding [GO:0005516]; carbon-sulfur lyase activity [GO:0016846]; cystathionine gamma-lyase activity [GO:0004123]; homocysteine desulfhydrase activity [GO:0047982]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; L-cysteine desulfhydrase activity [GO:0080146]; L-cystine L-cysteine-lyase (deaminating) [GO:0044540]; pyridoxal phosphate binding [GO:0030170]; selenocystathionine gamma-lyase activity [GO:0098606]; cellular response to leukemia inhibitory factor [GO:1990830]; cysteine biosynthetic process [GO:0019344]; cysteine biosynthetic process via cystathionine [GO:0019343]; cysteine metabolic process [GO:0006534]; endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response [GO:0030968]; hydrogen sulfide biosynthetic process [GO:0070814]; lipid metabolic process [GO:0006629]; negative regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:2001234]; positive regulation of aortic smooth muscle cell differentiation [GO:1904831]; positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling [GO:0043123]; positive regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity [GO:0051092]; protein homotetramerization [GO:0051289]; protein sulfhydration [GO:0044524]; protein-pyridoxal-5-phosphate linkage via peptidyl-N6-pyridoxal phosphate-L-lysine [GO:0018272]; transsulfuration [GO:0019346]","P32929; Q96NT3; Q96NT3-2; Q96HA8; Q6P9E2","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.","ENST00000346806.2 [P32929-2];ENST00000370938.8 [P32929-1];ENST00000411986.6 [P32929-3];",0.00040852881862132

Acts as a central dissolvase of membraneless organelles during the G2-to-M transition, after the nuclear-envelope breakdown: acts by mediating phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in unstructured domains of proteins, such as SRRM1 and PCM1 (PubMed:29973724). Does not mediate disassembly of all membraneless organelles: disassembly of P-body and nucleolus is not regulated by DYRK3 (PubMed:29973724). Dissolution of membraneless organelles at the onset of mitosis is also required to release mitotic regulators, such as ZNF207, from liquid-unmixed organelles where they are sequestered and keep them dissolved during mitosis (PubMed:29973724). Regulates mTORC1 by mediating the dissolution of stress granules: during stressful conditions, DYRK3 partitions from the cytosol to the stress granule, together with mTORC1 components, which prevents mTORC1 signaling (PubMed:23415227). When stress signals are gone, the kinase activity of DYRK3 is required for the dissolution of stress granule and mTORC1 relocation to the cytosol: acts by mediating the phosphorylation of the mTORC1 inhibitor AKT1S1, allowing full reactivation of mTORC1 signaling (PubMed:23415227). Also acts as a negative regulator of EPO-dependent erythropoiesis: may place an upper limit on red cell production during stress erythropoiesis (PubMed:10779429). Inhibits cell death due to cytokine withdrawal in hematopoietic progenitor cells (PubMed:10779429). Promotes cell survival upon genotoxic stress through phosphorylation of SIRT1: this in turn inhibits p53/TP53 activity and apoptosis (PubMed:20167603). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10779429, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20167603, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23415227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29634919, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29973724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9748265}.","DYRK3","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytoplasmic stress granule [GO:0010494]; cytoskeleton [GO:0005856]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; intracellular membrane-bounded organelle [GO:0043231]; nuclear speck [GO:0016607]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; pericentriolar material [GO:0000242]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; magnesium ion binding [GO:0000287]; protein kinase activity [GO:0004672]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004712]; protein tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004713]; cell cycle [GO:0007049]; cell division [GO:0051301]; erythrocyte differentiation [GO:0030218]; negative regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043066]; negative regulation of DNA damage response, signal transduction by p53 class mediator [GO:0043518]; nuclear speck organization [GO:0035063]; organelle disassembly [GO:1903008]; peptidyl-serine phosphorylation [GO:0018105]; peptidyl-threonine phosphorylation [GO:0018107]; positive regulation of cell cycle G2/M phase transition [GO:1902751]; protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]; regulation of cellular response to stress [GO:0080135]; regulation of TORC1 signaling [GO:1903432]; stress granule disassembly [GO:0035617]","Q9H8Y8","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10779429, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20167603, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29973724}.

The phosphorylation of EPRS1, induced by interferon-gamma, dissociates the protein from the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase multienzyme complex and recruits it to the GAIT complex that binds to stem loop-containing GAIT elements in the 3'-UTR of diverse inflammatory mRNAs (such as ceruplasmin), suppressing their translation. Interferon-gamma can therefore redirect, in specific cells, the EPRS1 function from protein synthesis to translation inhibition (PubMed:15479637, PubMed:23071094).

Regulates many physiological processes including proliferation, scattering, morphogenesis and survival. Ligand binding at the cell surface induces autophosphorylation of MET on its intracellular domain that provides docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. Following activation by ligand, interacts with the PI3-kinase subunit PIK3R1, PLCG1, SRC, GRB2, STAT3 or the adapter GAB1. Recruitment of these downstream effectors by MET leads to the activation of several signaling cascades including the RAS-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, or PLCgamma-PKC. The RAS-ERK activation is associated with the morphogenetic effects while PI3K/AKT coordinates prosurvival effects. During embryonic development, MET signaling plays a role in gastrulation, development and migration of muscles and neuronal precursors, angiogenesis and kidney formation. In adults, participates in wound healing as well as organ regeneration and tissue remodeling. Promotes also differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells.

The CBC complex is involved in mRNA export from the nucleus via its interaction with ALYREF/THOC4/ALY, leading to the recruitment of the mRNA export machinery to the 5' end of mRNA and to mRNA export in a 5' to 3' direction through the nuclear pore. The CBC complex is also involved in mediating U snRNA and intronless mRNAs export from the nucleus. The CBC complex is essential for a pioneer round of mRNA translation, before steady state translation when the CBC complex is replaced by cytoplasmic cap-binding protein eIF4E. The pioneer round of mRNA translation mediated by the CBC complex plays a central role in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), NMD only taking place in mRNAs bound to the CBC complex, but not on eIF4E-bound mRNAs. The CBC complex enhances NMD in mRNAs containing at least one exon-junction complex (EJC) via its interaction with UPF1, promoting the interaction between UPF1 and UPF2. The CBC complex is also involved in 'failsafe' NMD, which is independent of the EJC complex, while it does not participate in Staufen-mediated mRNA decay (SMD). During cell proliferation, the CBC complex is also involved in microRNAs (miRNAs) biogenesis via its interaction with SRRT/ARS2, thereby being required for miRNA-mediated RNA interference. The CBC complex also acts as a negative regulator of PARN, thereby acting as an inhibitor of mRNA deadenylation. In the CBC complex, NCBP2/CBP20 recognizes and binds capped RNAs (m7GpppG-capped RNA) but requires NCBP1/CBP80 to stabilize the movement of its N-terminal loop and lock the CBC into a high affinity cap-binding state with the cap structure. The conventional cap-binding complex with NCBP2 binds both small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and messenger (mRNA) and is involved in their export from the nucleus (PubMed:26382858). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11551508, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15361857, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17190602, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17363367, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17873884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18369367, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19632182, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26382858}.","NCBP2","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; mRNA cap binding complex [GO:0005845]; nuclear cap binding complex [GO:0005846]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; RNA cap binding complex [GO:0034518]; DNA binding [GO:0003677]; mRNA binding [GO:0003729]; RNA 7-methylguanosine cap binding [GO:0000340]; RNA binding [GO:0003723]; RNA cap binding [GO:0000339]; snRNA binding [GO:0017069]; alternative mRNA splicing, via spliceosome [GO:0000380]; cap-dependent translational initiation [GO:0002191]; histone mRNA metabolic process [GO:0008334]; miRNA-mediated gene silencing [GO:0035195]; mRNA 3'-end processing [GO:0031124]; mRNA cis splicing, via spliceosome [GO:0045292]; mRNA export from nucleus [GO:0006406]; mRNA splicing, via spliceosome [GO:0000398]; mRNA transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0042789]; nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process, nonsense-mediated decay [GO:0000184]; positive regulation of mRNA 3'-end processing [GO:0031442]; positive regulation of phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain [GO:1901409]; positive regulation of RNA export from nucleus [GO:0046833]; positive regulation of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II [GO:0032968]; pre-mRNA cleavage required for polyadenylation [GO:0098789]; primary miRNA processing [GO:0031053]; regulation of translational initiation [GO:0006446]; RNA splicing [GO:0008380]; snRNA export from nucleus [GO:0006408]","Q9BRK4; Q09161; Q14974-1; Q09161","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:8601613}.

Forms a dimeric enzyme where both of the subunits are able to form enzyme-CoA thiolester intermediates, but only one subunit is competent to transfer the CoA moiety to the acceptor carboxylate (3-oxo acid) and produce a new acyl-CoA. Formation of the enzyme-CoA intermediate proceeds via an unstable anhydride species formed between the carboxylate groups of the enzyme and substrate (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q29551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10964512}.","OXCT1","mitochondrial matrix [GO:0005759]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase activity [GO:0008260]; CoA-transferase activity [GO:0008410]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; succinyl-CoA 3-ketoacid-CoA transferase activity [GO:0106424]; adipose tissue development [GO:0060612]; brain development [GO:0007420]; cellular ketone body metabolic process [GO:0046950]; heart development [GO:0007507]; ketone body catabolic process [GO:0046952]; ketone catabolic process [GO:0042182]; positive regulation of insulin secretion involved in cellular response to glucose stimulus [GO:0035774]; response to activity [GO:0014823]; response to ethanol [GO:0045471]; response to hormone [GO:0009725]; response to nutrient [GO:0007584]; response to starvation [GO:0042594]; response to xenobiotic stimulus [GO:0009410]","","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:B2GV06}.","ENST00000196371.10 [P55809-1];ENST00000510634.5 [P55809-2];ENST00000512084.5 [P55809-2];",0.00897631813118582

Mediates cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix via integrin-dependent signaling, by mediating angiotensin-2-induced activation of integrin beta-1 (ITGB1) in cardiac fibroblasts. Phosphorylates MARCKS, which phosphorylates and activates PTK2/FAK, leading to the spread of cardiomyocytes. Involved in the control of the directional transport of ITGB1 in mesenchymal cells by phosphorylating vimentin (VIM), an intermediate filament (IF) protein. In epithelial cells, associates with and phosphorylates keratin-8 (KRT8), which induces targeting of desmoplakin at desmosomes and regulates cell-cell contact. Phosphorylates IQGAP1, which binds to CDC42, mediating epithelial cell-cell detachment prior to migration. In HeLa cells, contributes to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced cell migration, and in human corneal epithelial cells, plays a critical role in wound healing after activation by HGF. During cytokinesis, forms a complex with YWHAB, which is crucial for daughter cell separation, and facilitates abscission by a mechanism which may implicate the regulation of RHOA. In cardiac myocytes, regulates myofilament function and excitation coupling at the Z-lines, where it is indirectly associated with F-actin via interaction with COPB1. During endothelin-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, mediates activation of PTK2/FAK, which is critical for cardiomyocyte survival and regulation of sarcomere length. Plays a role in the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy via persistent phosphorylation of troponin I (TNNI3). Involved in nerve growth factor (NFG)-induced neurite outgrowth and neuron morphological change independently of its kinase activity, by inhibition of RHOA pathway, activation of CDC42 and cytoskeletal rearrangement. May be involved in presynaptic facilitation by mediating phorbol ester-induced synaptic potentiation. Phosphorylates gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit gamma-2 (GABRG2), which reduces the response of GABA receptors to ethanol and benzodiazepines and may mediate acute tolerance to the intoxicating effects of ethanol. Upon PMA treatment, phosphorylates the capsaicin- and heat-activated cation channel TRPV1, which is required for bradykinin-induced sensitization of the heat response in nociceptive neurons. Is able to form a complex with PDLIM5 and N-type calcium channel, and may enhance channel activities and potentiates fast synaptic transmission by phosphorylating the pore-forming alpha subunit CACNA1B (CaV2.2). In prostate cancer cells, interacts with and phosphorylates STAT3, which increases DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of STAT3 and seems to be essential for prostate cancer cell invasion. Downstream of TLR4, plays an important role in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced immune response by phosphorylating and activating TICAM2/TRAM, which in turn activates the transcription factor IRF3 and subsequent cytokines production.

Functions as an E3 ligase for oxidized IREB2 and both heme and oxygen are necessary for IREB2 ubiquitination (PubMed:12629548).

Component of the LUBAC complex which conjugates linear ('Met-1'-linked) polyubiquitin chains to substrates and plays a key role in NF-kappa-B activation and regulation of inflammation (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181, PubMed:19136968). LUBAC conjugates linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and RIPK1 and is involved in activation of the canonical NF-kappa-B and the JNK signaling pathways (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181, PubMed:19136968). Linear ubiquitination mediated by the LUBAC complex interferes with TNF-induced cell death and thereby prevents inflammation (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181). LUBAC is recruited to the TNF-R1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC) following polyubiquitination of TNF-RSC components by BIRC2 and/or BIRC3 and to conjugate linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and possibly other components contributing to the stability of the complex (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181, PubMed:19136968). The LUBAC complex is also involved in innate immunity by conjugating linear polyubiquitin chains at the surface of bacteria invading the cytosol to form the ubiquitin coat surrounding bacteria (PubMed:28481331). LUBAC is not able to initiate formation of the bacterial ubiquitin coat, and can only promote formation of linear polyubiquitins on pre-existing ubiquitin (PubMed:28481331). The bacterial ubiquitin coat acts as an 'eat-me' signal for xenophagy and promotes NF-kappa-B activation (PubMed:28481331).

NF-kappa-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NFKB1/p105, NFKB1/p50, REL and NFKB2/p52. The dimers bind at kappa-B sites in the DNA of their target genes and the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different kappa-B sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. Different dimer combinations act as transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively. NF-kappa-B is controlled by various mechanisms of post-translational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. NF-kappa-B complexes are held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state complexed with members of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor (I-kappa-B) family. In a conventional activation pathway, I-kappa-B is phosphorylated by I-kappa-B kinases (IKKs) in response to different activators, subsequently degraded thus liberating the active NF-kappa-B complex which translocates to the nucleus. NF-kappa-B heterodimeric RelB-p50 and RelB-p52 complexes are transcriptional activators. RELB neither associates with DNA nor with RELA/p65 or REL. Stimulates promoter activity in the presence of NFKB2/p49. As a member of the NUPR1/RELB/IER3 survival pathway, may provide pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with remarkable resistance to cell stress, such as starvation or gemcitabine treatment. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing the transcriptional activator activity of the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer in a CRY1/CRY2 independent manner.

The small ribosomal subunit (SSU) binds messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and translates the encoded message by selecting cognate aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The large subunit (LSU) contains the ribosomal catalytic site termed the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), which catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds, thereby polymerizing the amino acids delivered by tRNAs into a polypeptide chain. The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome through a tunnel in the LSU and interact with protein factors that function in enzymatic processing, targeting, and the membrane insertion of nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel. As part of the 5S RNP/5S ribonucleoprotein particle it is an essential component of the LSU, required for its formation and the maturation of rRNAs (PubMed:12962325, PubMed:19061985, PubMed:24120868, PubMed:23636399). It also couples ribosome biogenesis to p53/TP53 activation.

Has endonuclease activity and plays a role in repair of damaged DNA (PubMed:7775413). Cleaves phosphodiester bonds of DNAs containing altered bases with broad specificity and cleaves supercoiled DNA more efficiently than relaxed DNA (PubMed:15707971). Displays high binding affinity for 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), a common DNA lesion caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (PubMed:14706345). Has also been shown to bind with similar affinity to intact and damaged DNA (PubMed:18610840). Stimulates the N-glycosylase activity of the base excision protein OGG1 (PubMed:15518571). Enhances the uracil excision activity of UNG1 (PubMed:18973764). Also stimulates the cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone by APEX1 (PubMed:18973764). When located in the mitochondrion, reduces cellular ROS levels and mitochondrial DNA damage (PubMed:23911537). Has also been shown to negatively regulate DNA repair in cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide (PubMed:17049931). Plays a role in regulating transcription as part of the NF-kappa-B p65-p50 complex where it binds to the RELA/p65 subunit, enhances binding of the complex to DNA and promotes transcription of target genes (PubMed:18045535). Represses its own translation by binding to its cognate mRNA (PubMed:20217897). Binds to and protects TP53/p53 from MDM2-mediated ubiquitination (PubMed:19656744). Involved in spindle formation and chromosome movement during mitosis by regulating microtubule polymerization (PubMed:23131551). Involved in induction of apoptosis through its role in activation of CASP8 (PubMed:14988002). Induces neuronal apoptosis by interacting with the E2F1 transcription factor and acting synergistically with it to up-regulate pro-apoptotic proteins BCL2L11/BIM and HRK/Dp5 (PubMed:20605787). Interacts with TRADD following exposure to UV radiation and induces apoptosis by caspase-dependent JNK activation (PubMed:22510408). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14706345, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14988002, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15518571, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15707971, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17049931, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18045535, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18610840, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18973764, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19656744, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20217897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20605787, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22510408, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23131551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23911537, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7775413, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8706699}.","RPS3","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; cytosolic ribosome [GO:0022626]; cytosolic small ribosomal subunit [GO:0022627]; endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; focal adhesion [GO:0005925]; membrane [GO:0016020]; mitochondrial inner membrane [GO:0005743]; mitochondrial matrix [GO:0005759]; mitotic spindle [GO:0072686]; NF-kappaB complex [GO:0071159]; nucleolus [GO:0005730]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; polysome [GO:0005844]; postsynaptic density [GO:0014069]; ribonucleoprotein complex [GO:1990904]; ribosome [GO:0005840]; ruffle membrane [GO:0032587]; class I DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) endonuclease activity [GO:0140078]; damaged DNA binding [GO:0003684]; DNA binding [GO:0003677]; DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) endonuclease activity [GO:0003906]; DNA-binding transcription factor binding [GO:0140297]; endodeoxyribonuclease activity [GO:0004520]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; Hsp70 protein binding [GO:0030544]; Hsp90 protein binding [GO:0051879]; iron-sulfur cluster binding [GO:0051536]; kinase binding [GO:0019900]; microtubule binding [GO:0008017]; mRNA binding [GO:0003729]; oxidized purine DNA binding [GO:0032357]; oxidized pyrimidine DNA binding [GO:0032358]; protein kinase A binding [GO:0051018]; protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]; protein-containing complex binding [GO:0044877]; RNA binding [GO:0003723]; small ribosomal subunit rRNA binding [GO:0070181]; structural constituent of ribosome [GO:0003735]; supercoiled DNA binding [GO:0097100]; tubulin binding [GO:0015631]; ubiquitin-like protein conjugating enzyme binding [GO:0044390]; apoptotic process [GO:0006915]; cell division [GO:0051301]; cellular response to DNA damage stimulus [GO:0006974]; cellular response to hydrogen peroxide [GO:0070301]; cellular response to reactive oxygen species [GO:0034614]; cellular response to tumor necrosis factor [GO:0071356]; chromosome segregation [GO:0007059]; cytoplasmic translation [GO:0002181]; DNA repair [GO:0006281]; negative regulation of DNA repair [GO:0045738]; negative regulation of protein ubiquitination [GO:0031397]; negative regulation of translation [GO:0017148]; positive regulation of activated T cell proliferation [GO:0042104]; positive regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:2001235]; positive regulation of base-excision repair [GO:1905053]; positive regulation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in execution phase of apoptosis [GO:2001272]; positive regulation of DNA N-glycosylase activity [GO:1902546]; positive regulation of DNA repair [GO:0045739]; positive regulation of endodeoxyribonuclease activity [GO:0032079]; positive regulation of gene expression [GO:0010628]; positive regulation of interleukin-2 production [GO:0032743]; positive regulation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in response to DNA damage [GO:1902231]; positive regulation of JUN kinase activity [GO:0043507]; positive regulation of microtubule polymerization [GO:0031116]; positive regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity [GO:0051092]; positive regulation of NIK/NF-kappaB signaling [GO:1901224]; positive regulation of protein-containing complex assembly [GO:0031334]; positive regulation of T cell receptor signaling pathway [GO:0050862]; regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0042981]; response to TNF agonist [GO:0061481]; spindle assembly [GO:0051225]; translation [GO:0006412]; translational initiation [GO:0006413]","P42858; O14920; Q5S007; Q96GA3; Q00987; Q15843; P19838; P25963; Q08752; Q04206; P04637; P63104","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16314389, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17289661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17560175, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18045535, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20217897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21871177}.

Acts as an activator of the NFE2L2/NRF2 pathway via interaction with KEAP1: interaction inactivates the BCR(KEAP1) complex, promoting nuclear accumulation of NFE2L2/NRF2 and subsequent expression of cytoprotective genes (PubMed:20452972, PubMed:28380357, PubMed:33393215). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08623, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q64337, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10356400, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10747026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11244088, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12471037, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340068, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15802564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15911346, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15953362, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16079148, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16286508, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19931284, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20168092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20452972, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22622177, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24128730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27368102, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28380357, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28404643, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29496741, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33393215}.","SQSTM1","aggresome [GO:0016235]; amphisome [GO:0044753]; autolysosome [GO:0044754]; autophagosome [GO:0005776]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; inclusion body [GO:0016234]; intracellular membrane-bounded organelle [GO:0043231]; late endosome [GO:0005770]; Lewy body [GO:0097413]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; P-body [GO:0000932]; phagophore assembly site [GO:0000407]; PML body [GO:0016605]; sarcomere [GO:0030017]; sperm midpiece [GO:0097225]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; ionotropic glutamate receptor binding [GO:0035255]; K63-linked polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding [GO:0070530]; protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]; protein kinase C binding [GO:0005080]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein-containing complex binding [GO:0044877]; receptor tyrosine kinase binding [GO:0030971]; SH2 domain binding [GO:0042169]; ubiquitin binding [GO:0043130]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]; zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]; aggrephagy [GO:0035973]; apoptotic process [GO:0006915]; autophagy [GO:0006914]; autophagy of mitochondrion [GO:0000422]; brown fat cell proliferation [GO:0070342]; cell differentiation [GO:0030154]; endosomal transport [GO:0016197]; endosome organization [GO:0007032]; energy homeostasis [GO:0097009]; immune system process [GO:0002376]; intracellular signal transduction [GO:0035556]; macroautophagy [GO:0016236]; mitophagy [GO:0000423]; negative regulation of protein ubiquitination [GO:0031397]; negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0000122]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of long-term synaptic potentiation [GO:1900273]; positive regulation of protein localization to plasma membrane [GO:1903078]; positive regulation of protein phosphorylation [GO:0001934]; positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0045944]; protein import into nucleus [GO:0006606]; protein localization [GO:0008104]; protein localization to perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:1905719]; protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]; regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling [GO:0043122]; regulation of mitochondrion organization [GO:0010821]; regulation of protein complex stability [GO:0061635]; regulation of Ras protein signal transduction [GO:0046578]; response to ischemia [GO:0002931]; response to mitochondrial depolarisation [GO:0098780]; selective autophagy [GO:0061912]; temperature homeostasis [GO:0001659]; transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0006366]; ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0006511]","P05067; P54253; O95817; Q16543; P34972; Q15038; O14576-2; Q2V2M9; Q2V2M9-4; O95166; Q9H0R8; P60520; P0DMV8; P42858; Q9Y6K9; Q14145; Q5S007; Q9UDY8; Q9H492; Q9GZQ8; Q9BXW4; Q13163; Q14596; P04629; Q96CV9; P50542-3; Q9UGJ0; P41743; Q12923; P54725; P58004; Q96B97; P84022; P37840; Q13501; Q9UNE7; Q9Y4K3; P07437; P0CG48; P11473; Q9UBQ0-2; Q8IZQ1; P19544-6; A0A024RC47; A8K2U6; P38182; Q9Z2X8; P28700; O70405; P12504","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20168092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22792322}.

Involved in immune and inflammatory responses signaled by cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, or pathogens via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) through terminating NF-kappa-B activity. Essential component of a ubiquitin-editing protein complex, comprising also RNF11, ITCH and TAX1BP1, that ensures the transient nature of inflammatory signaling pathways. In cooperation with TAX1BP1 promotes disassembly of E2-E3 ubiquitin protein ligase complexes in IL-1R and TNFR-1 pathways; affected are at least E3 ligases TRAF6, TRAF2 and BIRC2, and E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBE2N and UBE2D3. In cooperation with TAX1BP1 promotes ubiquitination of UBE2N and proteasomal degradation of UBE2N and UBE2D3. Upon TNF stimulation, deubiquitinates 'Lys-63'-polyubiquitin chains on RIPK1 and catalyzes the formation of 'Lys-48'-polyubiquitin chains. This leads to RIPK1 proteasomal degradation and consequently termination of the TNF- or LPS-mediated activation of NF-kappa-B. Deubiquitinates TRAF6 probably acting on 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin. Upon T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated T-cell activation, deubiquitinates 'Lys-63'-polyubiquitin chains on MALT1 thereby mediating disassociation of the CBM (CARD11:BCL10:MALT1) and IKK complexes and preventing sustained IKK activation. Deubiquitinates NEMO/IKBKG; the function is facilitated by TNIP1 and leads to inhibition of NF-kappa-B activation. Upon stimulation by bacterial peptidoglycans, probably deubiquitinates RIPK2. Can also inhibit I-kappa-B-kinase (IKK) through a non-catalytic mechanism which involves polyubiquitin; polyubiquitin promotes association with IKBKG and prevents IKK MAP3K7-mediated phosphorylation.

Trophic-factor deprivation triggers the cleavage of surface APP by beta-secretase to release sAPP-beta which is further cleaved to release an N-terminal fragment of APP (N-APP). N-APP binds TNFRSF21; this triggers caspase activation and degeneration of both neuronal cell bodies (via caspase-3) and axons (via caspase-6). Negatively regulates oligodendrocyte survival, maturation and myelination. Plays a role in signaling cascades triggered by stimulation of T-cell receptors, in the adaptive immune response and in the regulation of T-cell differentiation and proliferation. Negatively regulates T-cell responses and the release of cytokines such as IL4, IL5, IL10, IL13 and IFNG by Th2 cells. Negatively regulates the production of IgG, IgM and IgM in response to antigens.

Acts as an important regulator of the cell cycle that participates in the maintenance of genome integrity. During cell cycle progression in embryonic fibroblast, prevents replication fork collapse, double-strand break formation and cell cycle checkpoint activation. Controls mitotic cell cycle progression and cell survival in rapidly proliferating intestinal epithelium and embryonic stem cells. During the embryo preimplantation, controls different aspects of M phase. During early oocyte growth, plays a role in oocyte survival by preventing chromosomal breaks formation, activation of TP63 and reduction of transcription (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8R1N0, ECO:0000305|PubMed:25599396}.","ZNF830","chromosome [GO:0005694]; nuclear speck [GO:0016607]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; spliceosomal complex [GO:0005681]; nucleic acid binding [GO:0003676]; zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]; blastocyst growth [GO:0001832]; cell division [GO:0051301]; chromosome organization [GO:0051276]; intestinal epithelial structure maintenance [GO:0060729]; mitotic DNA damage checkpoint signaling [GO:0044773]; mitotic DNA replication checkpoint signaling [GO:0033314]; mRNA processing [GO:0006397]; negative regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043066]; nuclear DNA replication [GO:0033260]; ovarian follicle development [GO:0001541]; preantral ovarian follicle growth [GO:0001546]; replication fork protection [GO:0048478]; RNA splicing [GO:0008380]","O60306; Q13123; Q15365; Q13356; Q6P2Q9; Q86VW0; Q13435; Q13573","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25599396}.
