Together with PELO and HBS1L, is required for 48S complex formation from 80S ribosomes and dissociation of vacant 80S ribosomes (PubMed:21448132). Together with PELO and HBS1L, recognizes stalled ribosomes and promotes dissociation of elongation complexes assembled on non-stop mRNAs; this triggers endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA, a mechanism to release non-functional ribosomes and to degrade damaged mRNAs as part of the No-Go Decay (NGD) pathway (PubMed:21448132). Plays a role in the regulation of mRNA turnover (By similarity). Plays a role in quality control of translation of mitochondrial outer membrane-localized mRNA (PubMed:29861391).

Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis (PubMed:16581796). AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules (By similarity). AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway (PubMed:19033387). During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (PubMed:23676497). The AP-2 mu subunit binds to transmembrane cargo proteins; it recognizes the Y-X-X-Phi motifs (By similarity). The surface region interacting with to the Y-X-X-Phi motif is inaccessible in cytosolic AP-2, but becomes accessible through a conformational change following phosphorylation of AP-2 mu subunit at Thr-156 in membrane-associated AP-2 (PubMed:11877457). The membrane-specific phosphorylation event appears to involve assembled clathrin which activates the AP-2 mu kinase AAK1 (PubMed:11877457). Plays a role in endocytosis of frizzled family members upon Wnt signaling (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11877457, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12694563, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12952941, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14745134, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14985334, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15473838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16581796, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19033387, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23676497, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31104773}.","AP2M1","AP-2 adaptor complex [GO:0030122]; clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle [GO:0045334]; clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle membrane [GO:0030669]; clathrin-coated pit [GO:0005905]; cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane [GO:0009898]; cytoplasmic vesicle [GO:0031410]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endocytic vesicle membrane [GO:0030666]; endolysosome membrane [GO:0036020]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; glutamatergic synapse [GO:0098978]; lysosomal membrane [GO:0005765]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; postsynapse [GO:0098794]; presynapse [GO:0098793]; clathrin adaptor activity [GO:0035615]; disordered domain specific binding [GO:0097718]; lipid binding [GO:0008289]; low-density lipoprotein particle receptor binding [GO:0050750]; signal sequence binding [GO:0005048]; transmembrane transporter binding [GO:0044325]; clathrin-dependent endocytosis [GO:0072583]; endocytosis [GO:0006897]; intracellular protein transport [GO:0006886]; negative regulation of protein localization to plasma membrane [GO:1903077]; positive regulation of receptor internalization [GO:0002092]; positive regulation of synaptic vesicle endocytosis [GO:1900244]; postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor internalization [GO:0098884]; protein-containing complex assembly [GO:0065003]; receptor internalization [GO:0031623]; regulation of vesicle size [GO:0097494]; synaptic vesicle endocytosis [GO:0048488]; vesicle budding from membrane [GO:0006900]; vesicle-mediated transport [GO:0016192]","Q9BYF1; P63010; Q7Z3C6; P0DPH9; Q96JC9; P00533; Q8N9N8; Q86YD7; P51114; Q99880; Q16778; P62807; Q96MH2; Q1ED39; Q8N8X9; P55081; Q9BU76; Q00013; Q8N3F0; Q9BSU3; Q6ZUT1; Q99633; Q8NAV1; Q9NZ81; Q03393; P35268; Q9UHP6; Q92609; Q96EY4; Q68CQ4; Q9P0T4; PRO_0000037566 [P27958]","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:31104773}.

Binds to asymmetric CRE's as a heterodimer and to palindromic CRE's as a homodimer (By similarity). Core effector of the ISR, which is required for adaptation to various stress such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, amino acid starvation, mitochondrial stress or oxidative stress (PubMed:32132707). During ISR, ATF4 translation is induced via an alternative ribosome translation re-initiation mechanism in response to EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation, and stress-induced ATF4 acts as a master transcription factor of stress-responsive genes in order to promote cell recovery (PubMed:32132706, PubMed:32132707). Promotes the transcription of genes linked to amino acid sufficiency and resistance to oxidative stress to protect cells against metabolic consequences of ER oxidation (By similarity). Activates the transcription of NLRP1, possibly in concert with other factors in response to ER stress (PubMed:26086088). Activates the transcription of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) in response to amino acid deprivation or ER stress (PubMed:11960987). However, when associated with DDIT3/CHOP, the transcriptional activation of the ASNS gene is inhibited in response to amino acid deprivation (PubMed:18940792). Together with DDIT3/CHOP, mediates programmed cell death by promoting the expression of genes involved in cellular amino acid metabolic processes, mRNA translation and the terminal unfolded protein response (terminal UPR), a cellular response that elicits programmed cell death when ER stress is prolonged and unresolved (By similarity). Together with DDIT3/CHOP, activates the transcription of the IRS-regulator TRIB3 and promotes ER stress-induced neuronal cell death by regulating the expression of BBC3/PUMA in response to ER stress (PubMed:15775988). May cooperate with the UPR transcriptional regulator QRICH1 to regulate ER protein homeostasis which is critical for cell viability in response to ER stress (PubMed:33384352). In the absence of stress, ATF4 translation is at low levels and it is required for normal metabolic processes such as embryonic lens formation, fetal liver hematopoiesis, bone development and synaptic plasticity (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of osteoblast differentiation in response to phosphorylation by RPS6KA3/RSK2: phosphorylation in osteoblasts enhances transactivation activity and promotes expression of osteoblast-specific genes and post-transcriptionally regulates the synthesis of Type I collagen, the main constituent of the bone matrix (PubMed:15109498). Cooperates with FOXO1 in osteoblasts to regulate glucose homeostasis through suppression of beta-cell production and decrease in insulin production (By similarity). Activates transcription of SIRT4 (By similarity). Regulates the circadian expression of the core clock component PER2 and the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 (By similarity). Binds in a circadian time-dependent manner to the cAMP response elements (CRE) in the SLC6A4 and PER2 promoters and periodically activates the transcription of these genes (By similarity). Mainly acts as a transcriptional activator in cellular stress adaptation, but it can also act as a transcriptional repressor: acts as a regulator of synaptic plasticity by repressing transcription, thereby inhibiting induction and maintenance of long-term memory (By similarity). Regulates synaptic functions via interaction with DISC1 in neurons, which inhibits ATF4 transcription factor activity by disrupting ATF4 dimerization and DNA-binding (PubMed:31444471). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q06507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11960987, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15109498, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15775988, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16682973, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17684156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18940792, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26086088, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31444471, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32132706, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32132707, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33384352}.;

Ligand binding at the cell surface induces dimerization and autophosphorylation of AXL. Following activation by ligand, AXL binds and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PI3-kinase subunits PIK3R1, PIK3R2 and PIK3R3; but also GRB2, PLCG1, LCK and PTPN11. Other downstream substrate candidates for AXL are CBL, NCK2, SOCS1 and TNS2. Recruitment of GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase regulatory subunits by AXL leads to the downstream activation of the AKT kinase. GAS6/AXL signaling plays a role in various processes such as endothelial cell survival during acidification by preventing apoptosis, optimal cytokine signaling during human natural killer cell development, hepatic regeneration, gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuron survival and migration, platelet activation, or regulation of thrombotic responses.

Does not have activity toward 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains. Component of the BRCA1-A complex, a complex that specifically recognizes 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitinated histones H2A and H2AX at DNA lesions sites, leading to target the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer to sites of DNA damage at double-strand breaks (DSBs). In the BRCA1-A complex, it specifically removes 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin on histones H2A and H2AX, antagonizing the RNF8-dependent ubiquitination at double-strand breaks (DSBs) (PubMed:20656690). Catalytic subunit of the BRISC complex, a multiprotein complex that specifically cleaves 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin in various substrates (PubMed:20656690, PubMed:24075985, PubMed:26344097, PubMed:26195665). Mediates the specific 'Lys-63'-specific deubiquitination associated with the COP9 signalosome complex (CSN), via the interaction of the BRISC complex with the CSN complex (PubMed:19214193). The BRISC complex is required for normal mitotic spindle assembly and microtubule attachment to kinetochores via its role in deubiquitinating NUMA1 (PubMed:26195665). Plays a role in interferon signaling via its role in the deubiquitination of the interferon receptor IFNAR1; deubiquitination increases IFNAR1 activity by enhancing its stability and cell surface expression (PubMed:24075985, PubMed:26344097). Down-regulates the response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via its role in IFNAR1 deubiquitination (PubMed:24075985).

MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and mostly are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins, such as stimulated growth factor receptors, lysosomal enzymes and lipids. The MVB pathway appears to require the sequential function of ESCRT-O, -I,-II and -III complexes. ESCRT-III proteins mostly dissociate from the invaginating membrane before the ILV is released. The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the terminal stages of cytokinesis and the budding of enveloped viruses (HIV-1 and other lentiviruses).

Most frizzled receptors are coupled to the beta-catenin canonical signaling pathway, which leads to the activation of disheveled proteins, inhibition of GSK-3 kinase, nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and activation of Wnt target genes.

Both pathways seem to involve interactions with G-proteins. Activation by WNT8 induces expression of beta-catenin target genes (By similarity). Following ligand activation, binds to CCDC88C/DAPLE which displaces DVL1 from FZD7 and leads to inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling, activation of G-proteins by CCDC88C and triggering of non-canonical Wnt responses (PubMed:26126266). May be involved in transduction and intercellular transmission of polarity information during tissue morphogenesis and/or in differentiated tissues. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q61090, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26126266}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for C.difficile toxin TcdB in the colonic epithelium. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:27680706}.","FZD7","integral component of membrane [GO:0016021]; intracellular membrane-bounded organelle [GO:0043231]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; recycling endosome membrane [GO:0055038]; frizzled binding [GO:0005109]; G protein-coupled receptor activity [GO:0004930]; PDZ domain binding [GO:0030165]; phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding [GO:0005546]; Wnt receptor activity [GO:0042813]; Wnt-protein binding [GO:0017147]; canonical Wnt signaling pathway [GO:0060070]; cellular response to retinoic acid [GO:0071300]; mesenchymal to epithelial transition [GO:0060231]; negative regulation of cardiac muscle cell differentiation [GO:2000726]; negative regulation of cell-substrate adhesion [GO:0010812]; negative regulation of ectodermal cell fate specification [GO:0042666]; neuron differentiation [GO:0030182]; non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway via JNK cascade [GO:0038031]; positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription [GO:0045893]; positive regulation of epithelial cell proliferation involved in wound healing [GO:0060054]; positive regulation of JNK cascade [GO:0046330]; positive regulation of phosphorylation [GO:0042327]; regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway [GO:0060828]; regulation of DNA-templated transcription [GO:0006355]; skeletal muscle satellite cell maintenance involved in skeletal muscle regeneration [GO:0014834]; somatic stem cell division [GO:0048103]; stem cell population maintenance [GO:0019827]; substrate adhesion-dependent cell spreading [GO:0034446]; T cell differentiation in thymus [GO:0033077]; Wnt signaling pathway, planar cell polarity pathway [GO:0060071]","O43315; Q9BXK5; O15552; P37235; A8MZ59; P10620; P61601; P62166; P04156; O00560; O43765; Q96EQ0; O14863; Q9NP94; Q9H2J7; Q96Q45-2; Q9UMX0; Q9UHD9; P56703","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:27386966}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:27386966}.

Plays a pivotal role in the protein quality control system, ensuring the correct folding of proteins, the re-folding of misfolded proteins and controlling the targeting of proteins for subsequent degradation (PubMed:21150129, PubMed:21148293, PubMed:24732912, PubMed:27916661, PubMed:23018488). This is achieved through cycles of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis and ADP release, mediated by co-chaperones (PubMed:21150129, PubMed:21148293, PubMed:24732912, PubMed:27916661, PubMed:23018488, PubMed:12526792). The co-chaperones have been shown to not only regulate different steps of the ATPase cycle of HSP70, but they also have an individual specificity such that one co-chaperone may promote folding of a substrate while another may promote degradation (PubMed:21150129, PubMed:21148293, PubMed:24732912, PubMed:27916661, PubMed:23018488, PubMed:12526792). The affinity of HSP70 for polypeptides is regulated by its nucleotide bound state. In the ATP-bound form, it has a low affinity for substrate proteins. However, upon hydrolysis of the ATP to ADP, it undergoes a conformational change that increases its affinity for substrate proteins. HSP70 goes through repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange, which permits cycles of substrate binding and release. The HSP70-associated co-chaperones are of three types: J-domain co-chaperones HSP40s (stimulate ATPase hydrolysis by HSP70), the nucleotide exchange factors (NEF) such as BAG1/2/3 (facilitate conversion of HSP70 from the ADP-bound to the ATP-bound state thereby promoting substrate release), and the TPR domain chaperones such as HOPX and STUB1 (PubMed:24318877, PubMed:27474739, PubMed:24121476, PubMed:26865365). Plays a critical role in mitochondrial import, delivers preproteins to the mitochondrial import receptor TOMM70 (PubMed:12526792). Acts as a repressor of transcriptional activation. Inhibits the transcriptional coactivator activity of CITED1 on Smad-mediated transcription. Component of the PRP19-CDC5L complex that forms an integral part of the spliceosome and is required for activating pre-mRNA splicing. May have a scaffolding role in the spliceosome assembly as it contacts all other components of the core complex. Binds bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and mediates LPS-induced inflammatory response, including TNF secretion by monocytes (PubMed:10722728, PubMed:11276205). Participates in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) quality control pathway in conjunction with J domain-containing co-chaperones and the E3 ligase STUB1 (PubMed:23990462). Interacts with VGF-derived peptide TLQP-21 (PubMed:28934328). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10722728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11276205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12526792, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21148293, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21150129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23018488, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23990462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24318877, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24732912, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27474739, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27916661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28934328, ECO:0000303|PubMed:24121476, ECO:0000303|PubMed:26865365}.","HSPA8","autophagosome [GO:0005776]; blood microparticle [GO:0072562]; chaperone complex [GO:0101031]; clathrin-sculpted gamma-aminobutyric acid transport vesicle membrane [GO:0061202]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; dendrite [GO:0030425]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; extracellular region [GO:0005576]; extracellular space [GO:0005615]; ficolin-1-rich granule lumen [GO:1904813]; focal adhesion [GO:0005925]; glutamatergic synapse [GO:0098978]; glycinergic synapse [GO:0098690]; late endosome [GO:0005770]; lumenal side of lysosomal membrane [GO:0098575]; lysosomal lumen [GO:0043202]; lysosomal membrane [GO:0005765]; lysosome [GO:0005764]; melanosome [GO:0042470]; membrane [GO:0016020]; nucleolus [GO:0005730]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:0048471]; photoreceptor ribbon synapse [GO:0098684]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; postsynaptic cytosol [GO:0099524]; postsynaptic specialization membrane [GO:0099634]; presynaptic cytosol [GO:0099523]; Prp19 complex [GO:0000974]; ribonucleoprotein complex [GO:1990904]; secretory granule lumen [GO:0034774]; spliceosomal complex [GO:0005681]; terminal bouton [GO:0043195]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; ATP hydrolysis activity [GO:0016887]; ATP-dependent protein disaggregase activity [GO:0140545]; ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone [GO:0140662]; C3HC4-type RING finger domain binding [GO:0055131]; cadherin binding [GO:0045296]; chaperone binding [GO:0051087]; clathrin-uncoating ATPase activity [GO:1990833]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; G protein-coupled receptor binding [GO:0001664]; heat shock protein binding [GO:0031072]; MHC class II protein complex binding [GO:0023026]; misfolded protein binding [GO:0051787]; phosphatidylserine binding [GO:0001786]; protein carrier chaperone [GO:0140597]; protein folding chaperone [GO:0044183]; protein-macromolecule adaptor activity [GO:0030674]; RNA binding [GO:0003723]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]; unfolded protein binding [GO:0051082]; ATP metabolic process [GO:0046034]; cellular response to starvation [GO:0009267]; cellular response to steroid hormone stimulus [GO:0071383]; cellular response to unfolded protein [GO:0034620]; chaperone cofactor-dependent protein refolding [GO:0051085]; chaperone-mediated autophagy [GO:0061684]; chaperone-mediated autophagy translocation complex disassembly [GO:1904764]; late endosomal microautophagy [GO:0061738]; membrane organization [GO:0061024]; mRNA splicing, via spliceosome [GO:0000398]; negative regulation of DNA-templated transcription [GO:0045892]; negative regulation of supramolecular fiber organization [GO:1902904]; positive regulation by host of viral genome replication [GO:0044829]; positive regulation of mRNA splicing, via spliceosome [GO:0048026]; protein folding [GO:0006457]; protein refolding [GO:0042026]; protein targeting to lysosome involved in chaperone-mediated autophagy [GO:0061740]; regulation of cell cycle [GO:0051726]; regulation of postsynapse organization [GO:0099175]; regulation of protein complex stability [GO:0061635]; regulation of protein import [GO:1904589]; regulation of protein stability [GO:0031647]; regulation of protein-containing complex assembly [GO:0043254]; response to unfolded protein [GO:0006986]; slow axonal transport [GO:1990832]; vesicle-mediated transport [GO:0016192]","P60709; Q9GZX7; P05067; P49407; P32121; Q9NQ11; P54253; Q99933; O95816; O95429; P00533; Q9BQI3; O14976; P01893; P34932; Q9NZL4; P42858; PRO_0000015820 [P01308]; P05412; P00338; Q5S007; P10636; P10636-6; P40692; P14598; O60260-5; Q15428; Q9UNE7; P61764; Q8TDR0; O00635; Q8AZK7; P03485; PRO_0000045603 [Q99IB8]; Q9UNE7-1","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.

Together with Hsp10, facilitates the correct folding of imported proteins. May also prevent misfolding and promote the refolding and proper assembly of unfolded polypeptides generated under stress conditions in the mitochondrial matrix (PubMed:1346131, PubMed:11422376). The functional units of these chaperonins consist of heptameric rings of the large subunit Hsp60, which function as a back-to-back double ring. In a cyclic reaction, Hsp60 ring complexes bind one unfolded substrate protein per ring, followed by the binding of ATP and association with 2 heptameric rings of the co-chaperonin Hsp10. This leads to sequestration of the substrate protein in the inner cavity of Hsp60 where, for a certain period of time, it can fold undisturbed by other cell components. Synchronous hydrolysis of ATP in all Hsp60 subunits results in the dissociation of the chaperonin rings and the release of ADP and the folded substrate protein (Probable). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11422376, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1346131, ECO:0000305|PubMed:25918392}.","HSPD1","cell surface [GO:0009986]; clathrin-coated pit [GO:0005905]; coated vesicle [GO:0030135]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; early endosome [GO:0005769]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; extracellular space [GO:0005615]; lipopolysaccharide receptor complex [GO:0046696]; membrane [GO:0016020]; mitochondrial inner membrane [GO:0005743]; mitochondrial matrix [GO:0005759]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; protein-containing complex [GO:0032991]; secretory granule [GO:0030141]; sperm midpiece [GO:0097225]; apolipoprotein A-I binding [GO:0034186]; apolipoprotein binding [GO:0034185]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; ATP hydrolysis activity [GO:0016887]; ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone [GO:0140662]; chaperone binding [GO:0051087]; DNA replication origin binding [GO:0003688]; double-stranded RNA binding [GO:0003725]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; high-density lipoprotein particle binding [GO:0008035]; isomerase activity [GO:0016853]; lipopolysaccharide binding [GO:0001530]; p53 binding [GO:0002039]; RNA binding [GO:0003723]; single-stranded DNA binding [GO:0003697]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]; unfolded protein binding [GO:0051082]; 'de novo' protein folding [GO:0006458]; activation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process [GO:0006919]; apoptotic mitochondrial changes [GO:0008637]; B cell activation [GO:0042113]; B cell proliferation [GO:0042100]; biological process involved in interaction with symbiont [GO:0051702]; chaperone-mediated protein complex assembly [GO:0051131]; isotype switching to IgG isotypes [GO:0048291]; mitochondrial unfolded protein response [GO:0034514]; MyD88-dependent toll-like receptor signaling pathway [GO:0002755]; negative regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043066]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of interferon-alpha production [GO:0032727]; positive regulation of interferon-gamma production [GO:0032729]; positive regulation of interleukin-10 production [GO:0032733]; positive regulation of interleukin-12 production [GO:0032735]; positive regulation of interleukin-6 production [GO:0032755]; positive regulation of macrophage activation [GO:0043032]; positive regulation of T cell activation [GO:0050870]; positive regulation of T cell mediated immune response to tumor cell [GO:0002842]; protein folding [GO:0006457]; protein import into mitochondrial intermembrane space [GO:0045041]; protein maturation [GO:0051604]; protein refolding [GO:0042026]; protein stabilization [GO:0050821]; response to cold [GO:0009409]; response to unfolded protein [GO:0006986]; T cell activation [GO:0042110]","P61158; P05067; Q9NVI7; Q9UMX3; P38398; Q8NHQ1; P28329-3; A8MQ03; Q6PI48; Q9UBU7; A0A024RCP2; Q99944; Q6NXG1; Q99504; P22607; Q14957; P01112; Q0VD86; P05412; Q15323; O76011; Q6A162; P60410; P26371; Q14847-2; Q6ZQX7-4; Q9BRK4; Q9Y4C4; P12036; Q7Z3S9; Q8WUY3; O76081; O76081-6; Q8N6K7; Q12888; Q9UBQ0-2; Q9JJY3","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion matrix.","ENST00000345042.6 [P10809-1];ENST00000388968.8 [P10809-1];ENST00000418022.2 [P10809-1];ENST00000426480.2 [P10809-1];ENST00000428204.6 [P10809-1];ENST00000439605.2 [P10809-1];ENST00000452200.6 [P10809-1];ENST00000677913.1 [P10809-1];ENST00000678761.1 [P10809-1];",0.000533679469858996

It is also activated by the concentration of cytosolic Mg(2+). Its activation dampens the excitatory events that elevate the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration and/or depolarize the cell membrane. It therefore contributes to repolarization of the membrane potential. Plays a key role in controlling excitability in a number of systems, such as regulation of the contraction of smooth muscle, the tuning of hair cells in the cochlea, regulation of transmitter release, and innate immunity. In smooth muscles, its activation by high level of Ca(2+), caused by ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, regulates the membrane potential.

Acting autonomously, serves itself as NLS receptor. Docking of the importin/substrate complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated by KPNB1 through binding to nucleoporin FxFG repeats and the complex is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy requiring, Ran-dependent mechanism. At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, Ran binds to importin-beta and the three components separate and importin-alpha and -beta are re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP hydrolysis releases Ran from importin. The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Mediates autonomously the nuclear import of ribosomal proteins RPL23A, RPS7 and RPL5 (PubMed:11682607). In association with IPO7, mediates the nuclear import of H1 histone. In vitro, mediates nuclear import of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 histones. In case of HIV-1 infection, binds and mediates the nuclear import of HIV-1 Rev.

In contrast to classical G-protein coupled receptors, does not activate heterotrimeric G-proteins to transduce the signal. Its function as activator of the Wnt signaling pathway is required for the development of various organs, including liver, kidney, intestine, bone, reproductive tract and eye. May also act as a receptor for norrin (NDP), such results however require additional confirmation in vivo. Required during spermatogenesis to activate the Wnt signaling pathway in peritubular myoid cells. Required for the maintenance of intestinal stem cells and Paneth cell differentiation in postnatal intestinal crypts. Acts as a regulator of bone formation and remodeling. Involved in kidney development; required for maintaining the ureteric bud in an undifferentiated state. Involved in the development of the anterior segment of the eye. Required during erythropoiesis.

With MAP3K3/MKK3, catalyzes the concomitant phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in the MAP kinases p38 MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and MAPK14 and plays an important role in the regulation of cellular responses to cytokines and all kinds of stresses. Especially, MAP2K3/MKK3 and MAP2K6/MKK6 are both essential for the activation of MAPK11 and MAPK13 induced by environmental stress, whereas MAP2K6/MKK6 is the major MAPK11 activator in response to TNF. MAP2K6/MKK6 also phosphorylates and activates PAK6. The p38 MAP kinase signal transduction pathway leads to direct activation of transcription factors. Nuclear targets of p38 MAP kinase include the transcription factors ATF2 and ELK1. Within the p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway, MAP3K6/MKK6 mediates phosphorylation of STAT4 through MAPK14 activation, and is therefore required for STAT4 activation and STAT4-regulated gene expression in response to IL-12 stimulation. The pathway is also crucial for IL-6-induced SOCS3 expression and down-regulation of IL-6-mediated gene induction; and for IFNG-dependent gene transcription. Has a role in osteoclast differentiation through NF-kappa-B transactivation by TNFSF11, and in endochondral ossification and since SOX9 is another likely downstream target of the p38 MAPK pathway. MAP2K6/MKK6 mediates apoptotic cell death in thymocytes. Acts also as a regulator for melanocytes dendricity, through the modulation of Rho family GTPases. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10961885, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11727828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15550393, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20869211, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8622669, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8626699, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8663074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9218798}.","MAP2K6","cytoskeleton [GO:0005856]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; MAP kinase kinase activity [GO:0004708]; phosphatase activator activity [GO:0019211]; protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity [GO:0043539]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004713]; apoptotic process [GO:0006915]; bone development [GO:0060348]; cardiac muscle contraction [GO:0060048]; cellular response to sorbitol [GO:0072709]; cellular senescence [GO:0090398]; DNA damage induced protein phosphorylation [GO:0006975]; MAPK cascade [GO:0000165]; negative regulation of cold-induced thermogenesis [GO:0120163]; nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing signaling pathway [GO:0070423]; osteoblast differentiation [GO:0001649]; ovulation cycle process [GO:0022602]; p38MAPK cascade [GO:0038066]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of MAP kinase activity [GO:0043406]; positive regulation of nitric-oxide synthase biosynthetic process [GO:0051770]; positive regulation of prostaglandin secretion [GO:0032308]; regulation of cell cycle [GO:0051726]; regulation of signal transduction by p53 class mediator [GO:1901796]; response to ischemia [GO:0002931]; response to xenobiotic stimulus [GO:0009410]; signal transduction [GO:0007165]; stress-activated MAPK cascade [GO:0051403]","Q5S007; Q16539; Q16236; Q9NRD5; O76024; P52564-1","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9768359}.

Regulates many physiological processes including proliferation, scattering, morphogenesis and survival. Ligand binding at the cell surface induces autophosphorylation of MET on its intracellular domain that provides docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. Following activation by ligand, interacts with the PI3-kinase subunit PIK3R1, PLCG1, SRC, GRB2, STAT3 or the adapter GAB1. Recruitment of these downstream effectors by MET leads to the activation of several signaling cascades including the RAS-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, or PLCgamma-PKC. The RAS-ERK activation is associated with the morphogenetic effects while PI3K/AKT coordinates prosurvival effects. During embryonic development, MET signaling plays a role in gastrulation, development and migration of muscles and neuronal precursors, angiogenesis and kidney formation. In adults, participates in wound healing as well as organ regeneration and tissue remodeling. Promotes also differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells.

PubMed:21823666, PubMed:23455543). Plays a central role in regulating cellular methylation potential, by consuming S-adenosyl-L-methionine and limiting its availability for other methyltransferases. Actively mediates genome-wide epigenetic and transcriptional changes through hypomethylation of repressive chromatin marks, such as H3K27me3 (PubMed:26571212, PubMed:23455543, PubMed:31043742). In a developmental context, contributes to low levels of the repressive histone marks that characterize pluripotent embryonic stem cell pre-implantation state (PubMed:26571212). Acts as a metabolic regulator primarily on white adipose tissue energy expenditure as well as hepatic gluconeogenesis and cholesterol biosynthesis. In white adipocytes, regulates polyamine flux by consuming S-adenosyl-L-methionine which provides for propylamine group in polyamine biosynthesis, whereas by consuming nicotinamide controls NAD(+) levels through the salvage pathway (By similarity). Via its product N1-methylnicotinamide regulates protein acetylation in hepatocytes, by repressing the ubiquitination and increasing the stability of SIRT1 deacetylase (By similarity).

Involved in cell proliferation and cell growth arrest by positive and negative regulation of the cell cycle. Can promote cell growth by phosphorylating and activating RAF1, which mediates the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade, and/or by up-regulating CDKN1A, which facilitates active cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex formation in glioma cells. In intestinal cells stimulated by the phorbol ester PMA, can trigger a cell cycle arrest program which is associated with the accumulation of the hyper-phosphorylated growth-suppressive form of RB1 and induction of the CDK inhibitors CDKN1A and CDKN1B. Exhibits anti-apoptotic function in glioma cells and protects them from apoptosis by suppressing the p53/TP53-mediated activation of IGFBP3, and in leukemia cells mediates anti-apoptotic action by phosphorylating BCL2. During macrophage differentiation induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1), is translocated to the nucleus and is associated with macrophage development. After wounding, translocates from focal contacts to lamellipodia and participates in the modulation of desmosomal adhesion. Plays a role in cell motility by phosphorylating CSPG4, which induces association of CSPG4 with extensive lamellipodia at the cell periphery and polarization of the cell accompanied by increases in cell motility. During chemokine-induced CD4(+) T cell migration, phosphorylates CDC42-guanine exchange factor DOCK8 resulting in its dissociation from LRCH1 and the activation of GTPase CDC42 (PubMed:28028151). Is highly expressed in a number of cancer cells where it can act as a tumor promoter and is implicated in malignant phenotypes of several tumors such as gliomas and breast cancers. Negatively regulates myocardial contractility and positively regulates angiogenesis, platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in arteries. Mediates hypertrophic growth of neonatal cardiomyocytes, in part through a MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2)-dependent signaling pathway, and upon PMA treatment, is required to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy up to heart failure and death, by increasing protein synthesis, protein-DNA ratio and cell surface area. Regulates cardiomyocyte function by phosphorylating cardiac troponin T (TNNT2/CTNT), which induces significant reduction in actomyosin ATPase activity, myofilament calcium sensitivity and myocardial contractility. In angiogenesis, is required for full endothelial cell migration, adhesion to vitronectin (VTN), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)-dependent regulation of kinase activation and vascular tube formation. Involved in the stabilization of VEGFA mRNA at post-transcriptional level and mediates VEGFA-induced cell proliferation. In the regulation of calcium-induced platelet aggregation, mediates signals from the CD36/GP4 receptor for granule release, and activates the integrin heterodimer ITGA2B-ITGB3 through the RAP1GAP pathway for adhesion. During response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), may regulate selective LPS-induced macrophage functions involved in host defense and inflammation. But in some inflammatory responses, may negatively regulate NF-kappa-B-induced genes, through IL1A-dependent induction of NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA/IKBA). Upon stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), phosphorylates EIF4G1, which modulates EIF4G1 binding to MKNK1 and may be involved in the regulation of EIF4E phosphorylation. Phosphorylates KIT, leading to inhibition of KIT activity. Phosphorylates ATF2 which promotes cooperation between ATF2 and JUN, activating transcription. Phosphorylates SOCS2 at 'Ser-52' facilitating its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P20444, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10848585, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11909826, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12724315, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12832403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15016832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15504744, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15526160, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18056764, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19176525, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21576361, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23990668, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28028151, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9738012, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9830023, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9873035, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9927633}.","PRKCA","alphav-beta3 integrin-PKCalpha complex [GO:0035866]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; mitochondrial membrane [GO:0031966]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:0048471]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; calcium-dependent protein kinase C activity [GO:0004698]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; histone kinase activity (H3-T6 specific) [GO:0035403]; integrin binding [GO:0005178]; protein kinase activity [GO:0004672]; protein kinase C activity [GO:0004697]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]; angiogenesis [GO:0001525]; apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:0097190]; cell adhesion [GO:0007155]; desmosome assembly [GO:0002159]; intracellular signal transduction [GO:0035556]; mitotic nuclear membrane disassembly [GO:0007077]; negative regulation of glial cell apoptotic process [GO:0034351]; peptidyl-serine phosphorylation [GO:0018105]; peptidyl-threonine phosphorylation [GO:0018107]; positive regulation of adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway [GO:0106071]; positive regulation of angiogenesis [GO:0045766]; positive regulation of blood vessel endothelial cell migration [GO:0043536]; positive regulation of bone resorption [GO:0045780]; positive regulation of cardiac muscle hypertrophy [GO:0010613]; positive regulation of cell adhesion [GO:0045785]; positive regulation of cell migration [GO:0030335]; positive regulation of dense core granule biogenesis [GO:2000707]; positive regulation of endothelial cell migration [GO:0010595]; positive regulation of endothelial cell proliferation [GO:0001938]; positive regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade [GO:0070374]; positive regulation of lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0031666]; positive regulation of macrophage differentiation [GO:0045651]; positive regulation of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0045931]; post-translational protein modification [GO:0043687]; protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]; regulation of mRNA stability [GO:0043488]; regulation of platelet aggregation [GO:0090330]; response to interleukin-1 [GO:0070555]","Q15027; Q06481-5; Q66PJ3-4; Q13072; Q8N9N5-2; Q96A33; Q96LY2-2; P15169; P43234; O95424; O43598; P21728; P00533; P60228; Q96J88-3; Q8IVH2-2; Q96NE9-2; O14926; Q06547-3; P19440-3; Q9UJ42; P62805; Q9UBN7; P52597; Q92826; Q02363; Q96FT9-2; P17936; P26951; Q9BYR8; Q9Y234; P51884; Q9H213; P80192; Q15759; A0JLT2-2; Q9H8H3; Q8N983-3; P49821; Q2M1J6; Q9BRX2; Q9Y6X2; P11309-2; Q6P1J6-2; Q9UNA4; Q02156; P07225; Q3YEC7-3; O94844; Q9NWS8-3; Q9ULK6-3; P18077; P31431; Q99643; Q14141; Q01105-2; P37840; Q9Y5X0; P56693; Q9BRW5; O43761; P15884; Q3YBM2; P0CG48; P13051-2; Q8NB14; O95498; Q9NZC7-5; Q9BQ24; Q05CR2; Q8N0Y2-2; O15535; Q24008","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23990668}.

May be required for histone H3 and histone H4 ubiquitination in response to ultraviolet and for subsequent DNA repair. Promotes the neddylation of CUL1, CUL2, CUL4 and CUL4 via its interaction with UBE2M. Involved in the ubiquitination of KEAP1, ENC1 and KLHL41. In concert with ATF2 and CUL3, promotes degradation of KAT5 thereby attenuating its ability to acetylate and activate ATM. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10230407, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10579999, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11027288, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11961546, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15983046, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16678110, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16751180, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18397884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19112177, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19679664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22748924, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23455478, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27565346, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29769719}.","RBX1","Cul2-RING ubiquitin ligase complex [GO:0031462]; Cul3-RING ubiquitin ligase complex [GO:0031463]; Cul4A-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex [GO:0031464]; Cul4B-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex [GO:0031465]; Cul5-RING ubiquitin ligase complex [GO:0031466]; Cul7-RING ubiquitin ligase complex [GO:0031467]; cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex [GO:0031461]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; SCF ubiquitin ligase complex [GO:0019005]; cullin family protein binding [GO:0097602]; molecular adaptor activity [GO:0060090]; NEDD8 ligase activity [GO:0061663]; NEDD8 transferase activity [GO:0019788]; RNA polymerase II-specific DNA-binding transcription factor binding [GO:0061629]; ubiquitin protein ligase activity [GO:0061630]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]; ubiquitin-ubiquitin ligase activity [GO:0034450]; zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]; cellular response to chemical stress [GO:0062197]; cellular response to DNA damage stimulus [GO:0006974]; cellular response to UV [GO:0034644]; DNA repair [GO:0006281]; MAPK cascade [GO:0000165]; negative regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway [GO:0090090]; positive regulation of proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0032436]; positive regulation of protein autoubiquitination [GO:1902499]; post-translational protein modification [GO:0043687]; proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0043161]; protein K48-linked ubiquitination [GO:0070936]; protein monoubiquitination [GO:0006513]; protein neddylation [GO:0045116]; protein polyubiquitination [GO:0000209]; protein ubiquitination [GO:0016567]; SCF-dependent proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0031146]; ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0006511]","Q13616; Q13617; Q13620; Q93034; Q92990; P59991; Q9BYU1; P58004; Q13309; P61081","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11027288}.

Up-regulates Na(+) channels: SCNN1A/ENAC, SCN5A and ASIC1/ACCN2, K(+) channels: KCNJ1/ROMK1, KCNA1-5, KCNQ1-5 and KCNE1, epithelial Ca(2+) channels: TRPV5 and TRPV6, chloride channels: BSND, CLCN2 and CFTR, glutamate transporters: SLC1A3/EAAT1, SLC1A2 /EAAT2, SLC1A1/EAAT3, SLC1A6/EAAT4 and SLC1A7/EAAT5, amino acid transporters: SLC1A5/ASCT2, SLC38A1/SN1 and SLC6A19, creatine transporter: SLC6A8, Na(+)/dicarboxylate cotransporter: SLC13A2/NADC1, Na(+)-dependent phosphate cotransporter: SLC34A2/NAPI-2B, glutamate receptor: GRIK2/GLUR6. Up-regulates carriers: SLC9A3/NHE3, SLC12A1/NKCC2, SLC12A3/NCC, SLC5A3/SMIT, SLC2A1/GLUT1, SLC5A1/SGLT1 and SLC15A2/PEPT2. Regulates enzymes: GSK3A/B, PMM2 and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase, and transcription factors: CTNNB1 and nuclear factor NF-kappa-B. Stimulates sodium transport into epithelial cells by enhancing the stability and expression of SCNN1A/ENAC. This is achieved by phosphorylating the NEDD4L ubiquitin E3 ligase, promoting its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, thereby preventing it from binding to SCNN1A/ENAC and targeting it for degradation. Regulates store-operated Ca(+2) entry (SOCE) by stimulating ORAI1 and STIM1. Regulates KCNJ1/ROMK1 directly via its phosphorylation or indirectly via increased interaction with SLC9A3R2/NHERF2. Phosphorylates MDM2 and activates MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53/TP53. Phosphorylates MAPT/TAU and mediates microtubule depolymerization and neurite formation in hippocampal neurons. Phosphorylates SLC2A4/GLUT4 and up-regulates its activity. Phosphorylates APBB1/FE65 and promotes its localization to the nucleus. Phosphorylates MAPK1/ERK2 and activates it by enhancing its interaction with MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Phosphorylates FBXW7 and plays an inhibitory role in the NOTCH1 signaling. Phosphorylates FOXO1 resulting in its relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Phosphorylates FOXO3, promoting its exit from the nucleus and interference with FOXO3-dependent transcription. Phosphorylates BRAF and MAP3K3/MEKK3 and inhibits their activity. Phosphorylates SLC9A3/NHE3 in response to dexamethasone, resulting in its activation and increased localization at the cell membrane. Phosphorylates CREB1. Necessary for vascular remodeling during angiogenesis. Sustained high levels and activity may contribute to conditions such as hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Isoform 2 exhibited a greater effect on cell plasma membrane expression of SCNN1A/ENAC and Na(+) transport than isoform 1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154281, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11410590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11696533, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12397388, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12590200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12634932, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12650886, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12761204, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12911626, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14623317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14706641, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15040001, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15044175, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15234985, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15319523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15496163, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15733869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15737648, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15845389, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15888551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16036218, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16443776, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16982696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17382906, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18005662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18304449, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18753299, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19447520, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19756449, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20511718, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20730100, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21865597}.","SGK1","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endoplasmic reticulum membrane [GO:0005789]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nuclear speck [GO:0016607]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; calcium channel regulator activity [GO:0005246]; chloride channel regulator activity [GO:0017081]; potassium channel regulator activity [GO:0015459]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004712]; sodium channel regulator activity [GO:0017080]; apoptotic process [GO:0006915]; cellular response to aldosterone [GO:1904045]; cellular response to DNA damage stimulus [GO:0006974]; intracellular signal transduction [GO:0035556]; long-term memory [GO:0007616]; neuron projection morphogenesis [GO:0048812]; peptidyl-serine phosphorylation [GO:0018105]; positive regulation of transporter activity [GO:0032411]; protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]; regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0042981]; regulation of blood pressure [GO:0008217]; regulation of catalytic activity [GO:0050790]; regulation of cell growth [GO:0001558]; regulation of cell migration [GO:0030334]; regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0042127]; regulation of DNA-binding transcription factor activity [GO:0051090]; regulation of gastric acid secretion [GO:0060453]; regulation of signal transduction by p53 class mediator [GO:1901796]; renal sodium ion absorption [GO:0070294]; sodium ion transport [GO:0006814]","O15182; Q969L2; Q9ULP0-2; P49815; Q80UE6","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.

Required for protein transport from the Golgi apparatus to the lysosomes by a pathway that is independent of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR). Lysosomal proteins bind specifically to the receptor in the Golgi apparatus and the resulting receptor-ligand complex is transported to an acidic prelysosomal compartment where the low pH mediates the dissociation of the complex (PubMed:16787399). The receptor is then recycled back to the Golgi for another round of trafficking through its binding to the retromer. Also required for protein transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endosomes. Promotes neuronal apoptosis by mediating endocytosis of the proapoptotic precursor forms of BDNF (proBDNF) and NGFB (proNGFB). Also acts as a receptor for neurotensin. May promote mineralization of the extracellular matrix during osteogenic differentiation by scavenging extracellular LPL. Probably required in adipocytes for the formation of specialized storage vesicles containing the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 (GLUT4 storage vesicles, or GSVs).

Also binds to some promoter regions (By similarity). Plays a central role in successive steps of chondrocyte differentiation (By similarity). Absolutely required for precartilaginous condensation, the first step in chondrogenesis during which skeletal progenitors differentiate into prechondrocytes (By similarity). Together with SOX5 and SOX6, required for overt chondrogenesis when condensed prechondrocytes differentiate into early stage chondrocytes, the second step in chondrogenesis (By similarity). Later, required to direct hypertrophic maturation and block osteoblast differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes: maintains chondrocyte columnar proliferation, delays prehypertrophy and then prevents osteoblastic differentiation of chondrocytes by lowering beta-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling and RUNX2 expression (By similarity). Also required for chondrocyte hypertrophy, both indirectly, by keeping the lineage fate of chondrocytes, and directly, by remaining present in upper hypertrophic cells and transactivating COL10A1 along with MEF2C (By similarity). Low lipid levels are the main nutritional determinant for chondrogenic commitment of skeletal progenitor cells: when lipids levels are low, FOXO (FOXO1 and FOXO3) transcription factors promote expression of SOX9, which induces chondrogenic commitment and suppresses fatty acid oxidation (By similarity). Mechanistically, helps, but is not required, to remove epigenetic signatures of transcriptional repression and deposit active promoter and enhancer marks at chondrocyte-specific genes (By similarity). Acts in cooperation with the Hedgehog pathway-dependent GLI (GLI1 and GLI3) transcription factors (By similarity). In addition to cartilage development, also acts as a regulator of proliferation and differentiation in epithelial stem/progenitor cells: involved in the lung epithelium during branching morphogenesis, by balancing proliferation and differentiation and regulating the extracellular matrix (By similarity).

Involved in many biological processes, such as bone development, angiogenesis, wound healing, cellular differentiation, chromatin modification and apoptosis (PubMed:1683874, PubMed:7935379, PubMed:9252372, PubMed:27270573). Acts as a protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase by mediating the cross-linking of proteins, such as ACO2, HSPB6, FN1, HMGB1, RAP1GDS1, SLC25A4/ANT1, SPP1 and WDR54 (PubMed:23941696, PubMed:24349085, PubMed:29618516, PubMed:30458214). Under physiological conditions, the protein cross-linking activity is inhibited by GTP; inhibition is relieved by Ca(2+) in response to various stresses (PubMed:7649299, PubMed:7592956, PubMed:18092889). When secreted, catalyzes cross-linking of proteins of the extracellular matrix, such as FN1 and SPP1 resulting in the formation of scaffolds (PubMed:12506096). Plays a key role during apoptosis, both by (1) promoting the cross-linking of cytoskeletal proteins resulting in condensation of the cytoplasm, and by (2) mediating cross-linking proteins of the extracellular matrix, resulting in the irreversible formation of scaffolds that stabilize the integrity of the dying cells before their clearance by phagocytosis, thereby preventing the leakage of harmful intracellular components (PubMed:7935379, PubMed:9252372). In addition to protein cross-linking, can use different monoamine substrates to catalyze a vast array of protein post-translational modifications: mediates aminylation of serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline or histamine into glutamine residues of target proteins to generate protein serotonylation, dopaminylation, noradrenalinylation or histaminylation, respectively (PubMed:23797785, PubMed:30867594). Mediates protein serotonylation of small GTPases during activation and aggregation of platelets, leading to constitutive activation of these GTPases (By similarity). Plays a key role in chromatin organization by mediating serotonylation and dopaminylation of histone H3 (PubMed:30867594, PubMed:32273471). Catalyzes serotonylation of 'Gln-5' of histone H3 (H3Q5ser) during serotonergic neuron differentiation, thereby facilitating transcription (PubMed:30867594). Acts as a mediator of neurotransmission-independent role of nuclear dopamine in ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons: catalyzes dopaminylation of 'Gln-5' of histone H3 (H3Q5dop), thereby regulating relapse-related transcriptional plasticity in the reward system (PubMed:32273471). Regulates vein remodeling by mediating serotonylation and subsequent inactivation of ATP2A2/SERCA2 (By similarity). Also acts as a protein deamidase by mediating the side chain deamidation of specific glutamine residues of proteins to glutamate (PubMed:9623982, PubMed:20547769). Catalyzes specific deamidation of protein gliadin, a component of wheat gluten in the diet (PubMed:9623982). May also act as an isopeptidase cleaving the previously formed cross-links (PubMed:26250429, PubMed:27131890). Also able to participate in signaling pathways independently of its acyltransferase activity: acts as a signal transducer in alpha-1 adrenergic receptor-mediated stimulation of phospholipase C-delta (PLCD) activity and is required for coupling alpha-1 adrenergic agonists to the stimulation of phosphoinositide lipid metabolism (PubMed:8943303). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08587, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P21981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12506096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1683874, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18092889, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20547769, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23797785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23941696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24349085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26250429, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27131890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29618516, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30458214, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30867594, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31991788, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32273471, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7592956, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7649299, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7935379, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8943303, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9252372, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9623982, ECO:0000303|PubMed:27270573}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 2]: Has cytotoxic activity: is able to induce apoptosis independently of its acyltransferase activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17116873}.","TGM2","chromatin [GO:0000785]; collagen-containing extracellular matrix [GO:0062023]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; extracellular matrix [GO:0031012]; focal adhesion [GO:0005925]; intrinsic component of plasma membrane [GO:0031226]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:0048471]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; calcium ion binding [GO:0005509]; GTP binding [GO:0005525]; histone dopaminyltransferase activity [GO:0120297]; histone serotonyltransferase activity [GO:0120295]; peptidase activity [GO:0008233]; peptide histaminyltransferase activity [GO:0120299]; peptide noradrenalinyltransferase activity [GO:0120298]; protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase activity [GO:0003810]; protein-glutamine glutaminase activity [GO:0050568]; apoptotic cell clearance [GO:0043277]; bone development [GO:0060348]; branching involved in salivary gland morphogenesis [GO:0060445]; cellular response to cocaine [GO:0071314]; cellular response to dopamine [GO:1903351]; cellular response to serotonin [GO:1904015]; negative regulation of endoplasmic reticulum calcium ion concentration [GO:0032471]; peptide cross-linking [GO:0018149]; phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway [GO:0007200]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of cell adhesion [GO:0045785]; positive regulation of GTPase activity [GO:0043547]; positive regulation of mitochondrial calcium ion concentration [GO:0051561]; positive regulation of neurogenesis [GO:0050769]; positive regulation of small GTPase mediated signal transduction [GO:0051057]; protein deamination [GO:0018277]; protein homooligomerization [GO:0051260]; proteolysis [GO:0006508]; regulation of apoptotic cell clearance [GO:2000425]; regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0042981]; salivary gland cavitation [GO:0060662]","Q12802; PRO_0000000092 [P05067]; PRO_0000005794 [P39060]; P02751; P08727; PRO_0000018520 [P28300]; Q04206; P40337; G5E9A7; O00429-3; P50570-2; P29692-2; Q06787-7; P04792; P42858; O60333-2; D3DTS7; P60891; Q5T160; Q8N488; Q14141; O95416; Q7Z699; O14656-2; Q86WV8; P02766; Q9NYH9; O76024","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24349085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29618516, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9575137}.

Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may be involved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycle regulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in proteotoxic stress response and cell cycle; Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linked is involved in endocytosis, DNA-damage responses as well as in signaling processes leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B. Linear polymer chains formed via attachment by the initiator Met lead to cell signaling. Ubiquitin is usually conjugated to Lys residues of target proteins, however, in rare cases, conjugation to Cys or Ser residues has been observed. When polyubiquitin is free (unanchored-polyubiquitin), it also has distinct roles, such as in activation of protein kinases, and in signaling. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16543144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34239127, ECO:0000303|PubMed:19754430}.","UBB","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endocytic vesicle membrane [GO:0030666]; endoplasmic reticulum membrane [GO:0005789]; endosome membrane [GO:0010008]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; extracellular space [GO:0005615]; extrinsic component of mitochondrial outer membrane [GO:0031315]; mitochondrial outer membrane [GO:0005741]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; neuron projection [GO:0043005]; neuronal cell body [GO:0043025]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; vesicle [GO:0031982]; protein tag [GO:0031386]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]; energy homeostasis [GO:0097009]; fat pad development [GO:0060613]; female gonad development [GO:0008585]; female meiosis I [GO:0007144]; hypothalamus gonadotrophin-releasing hormone neuron development [GO:0021888]; male meiosis I [GO:0007141]; mitochondrion transport along microtubule [GO:0047497]; modification-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0019941]; neuron projection morphogenesis [GO:0048812]; positive regulation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway by p53 class mediator [GO:1902255]; positive regulation of protein monoubiquitination [GO:1902527]; positive regulation of protein ubiquitination [GO:0031398]; protein ubiquitination [GO:0016567]; regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential [GO:0051881]; regulation of neuron death [GO:1901214]; regulation of proteasomal protein catabolic process [GO:0061136]; seminiferous tubule development [GO:0072520]","P05067; Q8IVM0; Q9H305; Q15038; Q6ICB0; P28562; Q9UJY5; Q9NZ52; P33993; Q8N3F0; P46934; Q96FW1; Q6GQQ9-2; Q96CS7; Q9NRQ2; O60260-5; Q9UJ41; P54727; Q9Y3C5; Q68DV7; Q8N488; O00560; Q9HAU4; P00441; O75886; O95630; Q86VP1; Q9BSL1; Q9UHD9; P45974-2; Q8NA23-2; Q60592; Q9DLK6; P24610","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: [Ubiquitin]: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250}.
