Together with PELO and HBS1L, is required for 48S complex formation from 80S ribosomes and dissociation of vacant 80S ribosomes (PubMed:21448132). Together with PELO and HBS1L, recognizes stalled ribosomes and promotes dissociation of elongation complexes assembled on non-stop mRNAs; this triggers endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA, a mechanism to release non-functional ribosomes and to degrade damaged mRNAs as part of the No-Go Decay (NGD) pathway (PubMed:21448132). Plays a role in the regulation of mRNA turnover (By similarity). Plays a role in quality control of translation of mitochondrial outer membrane-localized mRNA (PubMed:29861391). As part of the PINK1-regulated signaling, ubiquitinated by CNOT4 upon mitochondria damage; this modification generates polyubiquitin signals that recruit autophagy receptors to the mitochondrial outer membrane and initiate mitophagy (PubMed:29861391).

Core effector of the ISR, which is required for adaptation to various stress such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, amino acid starvation, mitochondrial stress or oxidative stress (PubMed:32132707). During ISR, ATF4 translation is induced via an alternative ribosome translation re-initiation mechanism in response to EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation, and stress-induced ATF4 acts as a master transcription factor of stress-responsive genes in order to promote cell recovery (PubMed:32132706, PubMed:32132707).

Activates the transcription of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) in response to amino acid deprivation or ER stress (PubMed:11960987).

Together with DDIT3/CHOP, mediates programmed cell death by promoting the expression of genes involved in cellular amino acid metabolic processes, mRNA translation and the terminal unfolded protein response (terminal UPR), a cellular response that elicits programmed cell death when ER stress is prolonged and unresolved (By similarity). Together with DDIT3/CHOP, activates the transcription of the IRS-regulator TRIB3 and promotes ER stress-induced neuronal cell death by regulating the expression of BBC3/PUMA in response to ER stress (PubMed:15775988). May cooperate with the UPR transcriptional regulator QRICH1 to regulate ER protein homeostasis which is critical for cell viability in response to ER stress (PubMed:33384352). In the absence of stress, ATF4 translation is at low levels and it is required for normal metabolic processes such as embryonic lens formation, fetal liver hematopoiesis, bone development and synaptic plasticity (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of osteoblast differentiation in response to phosphorylation by RPS6KA3/RSK2: phosphorylation in osteoblasts enhances transactivation activity and promotes expression of osteoblast-specific genes and post-transcriptionally regulates the synthesis of Type I collagen, the main constituent of the bone matrix (PubMed:15109498). Cooperates with FOXO1 in osteoblasts to regulate glucose homeostasis through suppression of beta-cell production and decrease in insulin production (By similarity). Activates transcription of SIRT4 (By similarity). Regulates the circadian expression of the core clock component PER2 and the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 (By similarity). Binds in a circadian time-dependent manner to the cAMP response elements (CRE) in the SLC6A4 and PER2 promoters and periodically activates the transcription of these genes (By similarity). Mainly acts as a transcriptional activator in cellular stress adaptation, but it can also act as a transcriptional repressor: acts as a regulator of synaptic plasticity by repressing transcription, thereby inhibiting induction and maintenance of long-term memory (By similarity). Regulates synaptic functions via interaction with DISC1 in neurons, which inhibits ATF4 transcription factor activity by disrupting ATF4 dimerization and DNA-binding (PubMed:31444471). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q06507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11960987, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15109498, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15775988, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16682973, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17684156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18940792, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26086088, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31444471, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32132706, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32132707, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33384352}.;

Other downstream substrate candidates for AXL are CBL, NCK2, SOCS1 and TNS2. Recruitment of GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase regulatory subunits by AXL leads to the downstream activation of the AKT kinase. GAS6/AXL signaling plays a role in various processes such as endothelial cell survival during acidification by preventing apoptosis, optimal cytokine signaling during human natural killer cell development, hepatic regeneration, gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuron survival and migration, platelet activation, or regulation of thrombotic responses.

Does not have activity toward 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains. Component of the BRCA1-A complex, a complex that specifically recognizes 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitinated histones H2A and H2AX at DNA lesions sites, leading to target the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer to sites of DNA damage at double-strand breaks (DSBs).

Phosphorylates pRB/RB1 and NPM1. Interacts with D-type G1 cyclins during interphase at G1 to form a pRB/RB1 kinase and controls the entrance into the cell cycle. Involved in initiation and maintenance of cell cycle exit during cell differentiation; prevents cell proliferation and regulates negatively cell differentiation, but is required for the proliferation of specific cell types (e.g. erythroid and hematopoietic cells). Essential for cell proliferation within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles. Required during thymocyte development. Promotes the production of newborn neurons, probably by modulating G1 length. Promotes, at least in astrocytes, changes in patterns of gene expression, changes in the actin cytoskeleton including loss of stress fibers, and enhanced motility during cell differentiation. Prevents myeloid differentiation by interfering with RUNX1 and reducing its transcription transactivation activity, but promotes proliferation of normal myeloid progenitors. Delays senescence.

The signaling pathway downstream of the receptor is referred to as forward signaling while the signaling pathway downstream of the ephrin ligand is referred to as reverse signaling. Cognate/functional ephrin ligands for this receptor include EFNB1, EFNB2 and EFNB3. During nervous system development, regulates retinal axon guidance redirecting ipsilaterally ventrotemporal retinal ganglion cells axons at the optic chiasm midline. This probably requires repulsive interaction with EFNB2. In the adult nervous system together with EFNB3, regulates chemotaxis, proliferation and polarity of the hippocampus neural progenitors. In addition to its role in axon guidance also plays an important redundant role with other ephrin-B receptors in development and maturation of dendritic spines and synapse formation. May also regulate angiogenesis. More generally, may play a role in targeted cell migration and adhesion. Upon activation by EFNB1 and probably other ephrin-B ligands activates the MAPK/ERK and the JNK signaling cascades to regulate cell migration and adhesion respectively.

Plays a pivotal role in the protein quality control system, ensuring the correct folding of proteins, the re-folding of misfolded proteins and controlling the targeting of proteins for subsequent degradation (PubMed:21150129, PubMed:21148293, PubMed:24732912, PubMed:27916661, PubMed:23018488). This is achieved through cycles of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis and ADP release, mediated by co-chaperones (PubMed:21150129, PubMed:21148293, PubMed:24732912, PubMed:27916661, PubMed:23018488, PubMed:12526792). The co-chaperones have been shown to not only regulate different steps of the ATPase cycle of HSP70, but they also have an individual specificity such that one co-chaperone may promote folding of a substrate while another may promote degradation (PubMed:21150129, PubMed:21148293, PubMed:24732912, PubMed:27916661, PubMed:23018488, PubMed:12526792). The affinity of HSP70 for polypeptides is regulated by its nucleotide bound state. In the ATP-bound form, it has a low affinity for substrate proteins. However, upon hydrolysis of the ATP to ADP, it undergoes a conformational change that increases its affinity for substrate proteins. HSP70 goes through repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange, which permits cycles of substrate binding and release. The HSP70-associated co-chaperones are of three types: J-domain co-chaperones HSP40s (stimulate ATPase hydrolysis by HSP70), the nucleotide exchange factors (NEF) such as BAG1/2/3 (facilitate conversion of HSP70 from the ADP-bound to the ATP-bound state thereby promoting substrate release), and the TPR domain chaperones such as HOPX and STUB1 (PubMed:24318877, PubMed:27474739, PubMed:24121476, PubMed:26865365). Plays a critical role in mitochondrial import, delivers preproteins to the mitochondrial import receptor TOMM70 (PubMed:12526792). Acts as a repressor of transcriptional activation. Inhibits the transcriptional coactivator activity of CITED1 on Smad-mediated transcription. Component of the PRP19-CDC5L complex that forms an integral part of the spliceosome and is required for activating pre-mRNA splicing. May have a scaffolding role in the spliceosome assembly as it contacts all other components of the core complex. Binds bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and mediates LPS-induced inflammatory response, including TNF secretion by monocytes (PubMed:10722728, PubMed:11276205). Participates in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) quality control pathway in conjunction with J domain-containing co-chaperones and the E3 ligase STUB1 (PubMed:23990462).

This leads to sequestration of the substrate protein in the inner cavity of Hsp60 where, for a certain period of time, it can fold undisturbed by other cell components. Synchronous hydrolysis of ATP in all Hsp60 subunits results in the dissociation of the chaperonin rings and the release of ADP and the folded substrate protein (Probable). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11422376, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1346131, ECO:0000305|PubMed:25918392}.","HSPD1","cell surface [GO:0009986]; clathrin-coated pit [GO:0005905]; coated vesicle [GO:0030135]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; early endosome [GO:0005769]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; extracellular space [GO:0005615]; lipopolysaccharide receptor complex [GO:0046696]; membrane [GO:0016020]; mitochondrial inner membrane [GO:0005743]; mitochondrial matrix [GO:0005759]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; protein-containing complex [GO:0032991]; secretory granule [GO:0030141]; sperm midpiece [GO:0097225]; apolipoprotein A-I binding [GO:0034186]; apolipoprotein binding [GO:0034185]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; ATP hydrolysis activity [GO:0016887]; ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone [GO:0140662]; chaperone binding [GO:0051087]; DNA replication origin binding [GO:0003688]; double-stranded RNA binding [GO:0003725]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; high-density lipoprotein particle binding [GO:0008035]; isomerase activity [GO:0016853]; lipopolysaccharide binding [GO:0001530]; p53 binding [GO:0002039]; RNA binding [GO:0003723]; single-stranded DNA binding [GO:0003697]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]; unfolded protein binding [GO:0051082]; 'de novo' protein folding [GO:0006458]; activation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process [GO:0006919]; apoptotic mitochondrial changes [GO:0008637]; B cell activation [GO:0042113]; B cell proliferation [GO:0042100]; biological process involved in interaction with symbiont [GO:0051702]; chaperone-mediated protein complex assembly [GO:0051131]; isotype switching to IgG isotypes [GO:0048291]; mitochondrial unfolded protein response [GO:0034514]; MyD88-dependent toll-like receptor signaling pathway [GO:0002755]; negative regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043066]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of interferon-alpha production [GO:0032727]; positive regulation of interferon-gamma production [GO:0032729]; positive regulation of interleukin-10 production [GO:0032733]; positive regulation of interleukin-12 production [GO:0032735]; positive regulation of interleukin-6 production [GO:0032755]; positive regulation of macrophage activation [GO:0043032]; positive regulation of T cell activation [GO:0050870]; positive regulation of T cell mediated immune response to tumor cell [GO:0002842]; protein folding [GO:0006457]; protein import into mitochondrial intermembrane space [GO:0045041]; protein maturation [GO:0051604]; protein refolding [GO:0042026]; protein stabilization [GO:0050821]; response to cold [GO:0009409]; response to unfolded protein [GO:0006986]; T cell activation [GO:0042110]","P61158; P05067; Q9NVI7; Q9UMX3; P38398; Q8NHQ1; P28329-3; A8MQ03; Q6PI48; Q9UBU7; A0A024RCP2; Q99944; Q6NXG1; Q99504; P22607; Q14957; P01112; Q0VD86; P05412; Q15323; O76011; Q6A162; P60410; P26371; Q14847-2; Q6ZQX7-4; Q9BRK4; Q9Y4C4; P12036; Q7Z3S9; Q8WUY3; O76081; O76081-6; Q8N6K7; Q12888; Q9UBQ0-2; Q9JJY3","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion matrix.","ENST00000345042.6 [P10809-1];ENST00000388968.8 [P10809-1];ENST00000418022.2 [P10809-1];ENST00000426480.2 [P10809-1];ENST00000428204.6 [P10809-1];ENST00000439605.2 [P10809-1];ENST00000452200.6 [P10809-1];ENST00000677913.1 [P10809-1];ENST00000678761.1 [P10809-1];",0.000533679469858996

It therefore contributes to repolarization of the membrane potential. Plays a key role in controlling excitability in a number of systems, such as regulation of the contraction of smooth muscle, the tuning of hair cells in the cochlea, regulation of transmitter release, and innate immunity. In smooth muscles, its activation by high level of Ca(2+), caused by ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, regulates the membrane potential. In cochlea cells, its number and kinetic properties partly determine the characteristic frequency of each hair cell and thereby helps to establish a tonotopic map.

Regulates many physiological processes including proliferation, scattering, morphogenesis and survival. Ligand binding at the cell surface induces autophosphorylation of MET on its intracellular domain that provides docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. Following activation by ligand, interacts with the PI3-kinase subunit PIK3R1, PLCG1, SRC, GRB2, STAT3 or the adapter GAB1. Recruitment of these downstream effectors by MET leads to the activation of several signaling cascades including the RAS-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, or PLCgamma-PKC. The RAS-ERK activation is associated with the morphogenetic effects while PI3K/AKT coordinates prosurvival effects. During embryonic development, MET signaling plays a role in gastrulation, development and migration of muscles and neuronal precursors, angiogenesis and kidney formation. In adults, participates in wound healing as well as organ regeneration and tissue remodeling. Promotes also differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells.

Binds the TRE element in the promoter region of many genes that are regulated by TGF-beta and, on formation of the SMAD3/SMAD4 complex, activates transcription. Also can form a SMAD3/SMAD4/JUN/FOS complex at the AP-1/SMAD site to regulate TGF-beta-mediated transcription. Has an inhibitory effect on wound healing probably by modulating both growth and migration of primary keratinocytes and by altering the TGF-mediated chemotaxis of monocytes. This effect on wound healing appears to be hormone-sensitive. Regulator of chondrogenesis and osteogenesis and inhibits early healing of bone fractures. Positively regulates PDPK1 kinase activity by stimulating its dissociation from the 14-3-3 protein YWHAQ which acts as a negative regulator. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10995748, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15241418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15588252, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16156666, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16751101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16862174, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17327236, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19218245, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19289081, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9732876, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9892009}.","SMAD3","chromatin [GO:0000785];
