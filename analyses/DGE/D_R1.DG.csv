This stress-inducible metabolic regulator also plays a role in protection against oxidative and genotoxic stresses. May negatively regulate protein translation in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, via TORC1 (PubMed:24947615). May positively regulate the transcription by NFE2L2 of genes involved in the response to oxidative stress by facilitating the SQSTM1-mediated autophagic degradation of KEAP1 (PubMed:23274085).
