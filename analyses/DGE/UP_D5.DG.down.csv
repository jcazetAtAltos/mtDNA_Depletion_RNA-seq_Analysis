Acts in concert with PTHLH/PTHRP to stimulate ductal outgrowth during embryonic mammary development and to inhibit hair follicle induction (By similarity). Initiates the canonical BMP signaling cascade by associating with type I receptor BMPR1A and type II receptor BMPR2 (PubMed:25868050, PubMed:8006002). Once all three components are bound together in a complex at the cell surface, BMPR2 phosphorylates and activates BMPR1A. In turn, BMPR1A propagates signal by phosphorylating SMAD1/5/8 that travel to the nucleus and act as activators and repressors of transcription of target genes (PubMed:25868050, PubMed:29212066). Can also signal through non-canonical BMP pathways such as ERK/MAP kinase, PI3K/Akt, or SRC cascades (PubMed:31363885). For example, induces SRC phosphorylation which, in turn, activates VEGFR2, leading to an angiogenic response (PubMed:31363885). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P21275, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25868050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29212066, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31363885, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8006002}.","BMP4","endoplasmic reticulum lumen [GO:0005788];

Regulates endochondral bone development and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during the formation of the mammary glands and teeth. Required for skeletal homeostasis. Promotes mammary mesenchyme differentiation and bud outgrowth by modulating mesenchymal cell responsiveness to BMPs. Up-regulates BMPR1A expression in the mammary mesenchyme and this increases the sensitivity of these cells to BMPs and allows them to respond to BMP4 in a paracrine and/or autocrine fashion. BMP4 signaling in the mesenchyme, in turn, triggers epithelial outgrowth and augments MSX2 expression, which causes the mammary mesenchyme to inhibit hair follicle formation within the nipple sheath. {ECO:0000256|RuleBase:RU368098}.; FUNCTION: Osteostatin is a potent inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption. {ECO:0000256|RuleBase:RU368098}.","PTHLH","cytosol [GO:0005829]; extracellular region [GO:0005576]; Golgi apparatus [GO:0005794]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; hormone activity [GO:0005179]; peptide hormone receptor binding [GO:0051428]; bone mineralization [GO:0030282]","","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000256|RuleBase:RU368098}.
