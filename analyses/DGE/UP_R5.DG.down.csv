Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis (PubMed:16581796). AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules (By similarity). AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway (PubMed:19033387). During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (PubMed:23676497). The AP-2 mu subunit binds to transmembrane cargo proteins; it recognizes the Y-X-X-Phi motifs (By similarity). The surface region interacting with to the Y-X-X-Phi motif is inaccessible in cytosolic AP-2, but becomes accessible through a conformational change following phosphorylation of AP-2 mu subunit at Thr-156 in membrane-associated AP-2 (PubMed:11877457). The membrane-specific phosphorylation event appears to involve assembled clathrin which activates the AP-2 mu kinase AAK1 (PubMed:11877457). Plays a role in endocytosis of frizzled family members upon Wnt signaling (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11877457, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12694563, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12952941, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14745134, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14985334, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15473838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16581796, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19033387, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23676497, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31104773}.","AP2M1","AP-2 adaptor complex [GO:0030122]; clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle [GO:0045334]; clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle membrane [GO:0030669]; clathrin-coated pit [GO:0005905]; cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane [GO:0009898]; cytoplasmic vesicle [GO:0031410]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endocytic vesicle membrane [GO:0030666]; endolysosome membrane [GO:0036020]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; glutamatergic synapse [GO:0098978]; lysosomal membrane [GO:0005765]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; postsynapse [GO:0098794]; presynapse [GO:0098793]; clathrin adaptor activity [GO:0035615]; disordered domain specific binding [GO:0097718]; lipid binding [GO:0008289]; low-density lipoprotein particle receptor binding [GO:0050750]; signal sequence binding [GO:0005048]; transmembrane transporter binding [GO:0044325]; clathrin-dependent endocytosis [GO:0072583]; endocytosis [GO:0006897]; intracellular protein transport [GO:0006886]; negative regulation of protein localization to plasma membrane [GO:1903077]; positive regulation of receptor internalization [GO:0002092]; positive regulation of synaptic vesicle endocytosis [GO:1900244]; postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor internalization [GO:0098884]; protein-containing complex assembly [GO:0065003]; receptor internalization [GO:0031623]; regulation of vesicle size [GO:0097494]; synaptic vesicle endocytosis [GO:0048488]; vesicle budding from membrane [GO:0006900]; vesicle-mediated transport [GO:0016192]","Q9BYF1; P63010; Q7Z3C6; P0DPH9; Q96JC9; P00533; Q8N9N8; Q86YD7; P51114; Q99880; Q16778; P62807; Q96MH2; Q1ED39; Q8N8X9; P55081; Q9BU76; Q00013; Q8N3F0; Q9BSU3; Q6ZUT1; Q99633; Q8NAV1; Q9NZ81; Q03393; P35268; Q9UHP6; Q92609; Q96EY4; Q68CQ4; Q9P0T4; PRO_0000037566 [P27958]","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:31104773}.

MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and mostly are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins, such as stimulated growth factor receptors, lysosomal enzymes and lipids. The MVB pathway appears to require the sequential function of ESCRT-O, -I,-II and -III complexes. ESCRT-III proteins mostly dissociate from the invaginating membrane before the ILV is released. The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the terminal stages of cytokinesis and the budding of enveloped viruses (HIV-1 and other lentiviruses).

Mainly acts as a transcription repressor that binds DNA independently of DP proteins and specifically recognizes the E2 recognition site 5'-TTTC[CG]CGC-3'. Directly represses transcription of classical E2F transcription factors such as E2F1. Acts as a regulator of S-phase by recognizing and binding the E2-related site 5'-TTCCCGCC-3' and mediating repression of G1/S-regulated genes. Plays a key role in polyploidization of cells in placenta and liver by regulating the endocycle, probably by repressing genes promoting cytokinesis and antagonizing action of classical E2F proteins (E2F1, E2F2 and/or E2F3). Required for placental development by promoting polyploidization of trophoblast giant cells. Also involved in DNA damage response: up-regulated by p53/TP53 following genotoxic stress and acts as a downstream effector of p53/TP53-dependent repression by mediating repression of indirect p53/TP53 target genes involved in DNA replication. Acts as a promoter of sprouting angiogenesis, possibly by acting as a transcription activator: associates with HIF1A, recognizes and binds the VEGFA promoter, which is different from canonical E2 recognition site, and activates expression of the VEGFA gene. Acts as a negative regulator of keratinocyte differentiation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14633988, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15133492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18202719, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19223542, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21248772, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22802528, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22802529, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22903062}.","E2F7","chromatin [GO:0000785]; nuclear speck [GO:0016607]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; RNA polymerase II transcription regulator complex [GO:0090575]; cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0000987]; DNA-binding transcription factor activity [GO:0003700]; DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific [GO:0000981]; DNA-binding transcription repressor activity [GO:0001217]; DNA-binding transcription repressor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific [GO:0001227]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0000978]; sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding [GO:1990837]; chorionic trophoblast cell differentiation [GO:0060718]; DNA damage response, signal transduction by p53 class mediator [GO:0030330]; hepatocyte differentiation [GO:0070365]; negative regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0008285]; negative regulation of cytokinesis [GO:0032466]; negative regulation of G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle [GO:2000134]; negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0000122]; negative regulation of transcription involved in G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0071930]; placenta development [GO:0001890]; positive regulation of DNA endoreduplication [GO:0032877]; positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0045944]; regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0006357]; sprouting angiogenesis [GO:0002040]; trophoblast giant cell differentiation [GO:0060707]","Q96AV8; A0AVK6","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15133492}.","ENST00000322886.12 [Q96AV8-1];ENST00000416496.6 [Q96AV8-2];",0.000153855771480972

Most frizzled receptors are coupled to the beta-catenin canonical signaling pathway, which leads to the activation of disheveled proteins, inhibition of GSK-3 kinase, nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and activation of Wnt target genes. A second signaling pathway involving PKC and calcium fluxes has been seen for some family members, but it is not yet clear if it represents a distinct pathway or if it can be integrated in the canonical pathway, as PKC seems to be required for Wnt-mediated inactivation of GSK-3 kinase. Both pathways seem to involve interactions with G-proteins. Activation by WNT8 induces expression of beta-catenin target genes (By similarity). Following ligand activation, binds to CCDC88C/DAPLE which displaces DVL1 from FZD7 and leads to inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling, activation of G-proteins by CCDC88C and triggering of non-canonical Wnt responses (PubMed:26126266).

In presence of oxysterol, interacts with SCAP, retaining the SCAP-SREBP complex in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby preventing SCAP from escorting SREBF1/SREBP1 and SREBF2/SREBP2 to the Golgi (PubMed:15899885, PubMed:32322062). Sterol deprivation or phosphorylation by PCK1 reduce oxysterol-binding, disrupting the interaction between INSIG1 and SCAP, thereby promoting Golgi transport of the SCAP-SREBP complex, followed by processing and nuclear translocation of SREBF1/SREBP1 and SREBF2/SREBP2 (PubMed:32322062). Also regulates cholesterol synthesis by regulating degradation of HMGCR: initiates the sterol-mediated ubiquitin-mediated endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of HMGCR via recruitment of the reductase to the ubiquitin ligases AMFR/gp78 and/or RNF139 (PubMed:12535518, PubMed:16168377, PubMed:22143767). Also regulates degradation of SOAT2/ACAT2 when the lipid levels are low: initiates the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of SOAT2/ACAT2 via recruitment of the ubiquitin ligases AMFR/gp78 (PubMed:28604676). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12202038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12535518, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15899885, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16168377, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16399501, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16606821, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22143767, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28604676, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32322062}.","INSIG1","endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; endoplasmic reticulum membrane [GO:0005789]; SREBP-SCAP-Insig complex [GO:0032937]; oxysterol binding [GO:0008142]; cellular response to insulin stimulus [GO:0032869]; cellular response to sterol [GO:0036315]; cholesterol biosynthetic process [GO:0006695]; cholesterol homeostasis [GO:0042632]; cranial suture morphogenesis [GO:0060363]; inner ear morphogenesis [GO:0042472]; middle ear morphogenesis [GO:0042474]; negative regulation of cargo loading into COPII-coated vesicle [GO:1901303]; negative regulation of fat cell differentiation [GO:0045599]; negative regulation of fatty acid biosynthetic process [GO:0045717]; negative regulation of protein exit from endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0070862]; negative regulation of steroid biosynthetic process [GO:0010894]; roof of mouth development [GO:0060021]; SREBP signaling pathway [GO:0032933]; SREBP-SCAP complex retention in endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0036316]; sterol biosynthetic process [GO:0016126]; triglyceride metabolic process [GO:0006641]","Q9UKV5; Q13520; Q96Q45-2; P00180; P00181; P00347","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12202038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32322062}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12202038}.","ENST00000340368.9 [O15503-1];ENST00000342407.5 [O15503-2];",9.74136650649124e-08

Forms dimeric channels through which potassium ions pass in accordance with their electrochemical gradient. The channel is selective for K(+) ions at physiological potassium concentrations and at neutral pH, but becomes permeable to Na(+) at subphysiological K(+) levels and upon acidification of the extracellular medium (PubMed:21653227, PubMed:22431633). The homodimer has very low potassium channel activity, when expressed in heterologous systems, and can function as weakly inward rectifying potassium channel (PubMed:8605869, PubMed:8978667, PubMed:15820677, PubMed:21653227, PubMed:22431633, PubMed:23169818, PubMed:25001086). Channel activity is modulated by activation of serotonin receptors (By similarity). Heterodimeric channels containing KCNK1 and KCNK2 have much higher activity, and may represent the predominant form in astrocytes (By similarity). Heterodimeric channels containing KCNK1 and KCNK3 or KCNK9 have much higher activity (PubMed:23169818). Heterodimeric channels formed by KCNK1 and KCNK9 may contribute to halothane-sensitive currents (PubMed:23169818). Mediates outward rectifying potassium currents in dentate gyrus granule cells and contributes to the regulation of their resting membrane potential (By similarity). Contributes to the regulation of action potential firing in dentate gyrus granule cells and down-regulates their intrinsic excitability (By similarity). In astrocytes, the heterodimer formed by KCNK1 and KCNK2 is required for rapid glutamate release in response to activation of G-protein coupled receptors, such as F2R and CNR1 (By similarity). Required for normal ion and water transport in the kidney (By similarity). Contributes to the regulation of the resting membrane potential of pancreatic beta cells (By similarity). The low channel activity of homodimeric KCNK1 may be due to sumoylation (PubMed:15820677, PubMed:20498050, PubMed:23169818). The low channel activity may be due to rapid internalization from the cell membrane and retention in recycling endosomes (PubMed:19959478). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08581, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z2T2, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15820677, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17693262, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19959478, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20498050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21653227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22282804, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22431633, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23169818, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25001086, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8605869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8978667}.","KCNK1","anchoring junction [GO:0070161]; apical plasma membrane [GO:0016324]; brush border membrane [GO:0031526]; dendrite [GO:0030425]; integral component of membrane [GO:0016021]; integral component of plasma membrane [GO:0005887]; intracellular membrane-bounded organelle [GO:0043231]; inward rectifier potassium channel complex [GO:1902937]; perikaryon [GO:0043204]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; potassium channel complex [GO:0034705]; recycling endosome [GO:0055037]; synaptic membrane [GO:0097060]; voltage-gated potassium channel complex [GO:0008076]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; inward rectifier potassium channel activity [GO:0005242]; potassium channel activity [GO:0005267]; potassium ion leak channel activity [GO:0022841]; sodium channel activity [GO:0005272]; potassium ion transmembrane transport [GO:0071805]; potassium ion transport [GO:0006813]; regulation of resting membrane potential [GO:0060075]; response to nicotine [GO:0035094]; sodium ion transmembrane transport [GO:0035725]; stabilization of membrane potential [GO:0030322]","Q13520; O14735; Q96BA8; Q9Y282; O00180; P27105; P63165; Q8IV31; Q9NUH8","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15820677, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17693262, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20498050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21653227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22282804, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22431633, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23169818, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25001086, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8605869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8978667}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22282804, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8978667, ECO:0000305}.

In contrast to classical G-protein coupled receptors, does not activate heterotrimeric G-proteins to transduce the signal. Its function as activator of the Wnt signaling pathway is required for the development of various organs, including liver, kidney, intestine, bone, reproductive tract and eye. May also act as a receptor for norrin (NDP), such results however require additional confirmation in vivo. Required during spermatogenesis to activate the Wnt signaling pathway in peritubular myoid cells. Required for the maintenance of intestinal stem cells and Paneth cell differentiation in postnatal intestinal crypts. Acts as a regulator of bone formation and remodeling. Involved in kidney development; required for maintaining the ureteric bud in an undifferentiated state. Involved in the development of the anterior segment of the eye. Required during erythropoiesis. Also acts as a negative regulator of innate immunity by inhibiting TLR2/TLR4 associated pattern-recognition and pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

With MAP3K3/MKK3, catalyzes the concomitant phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in the MAP kinases p38 MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and MAPK14 and plays an important role in the regulation of cellular responses to cytokines and all kinds of stresses. Especially, MAP2K3/MKK3 and MAP2K6/MKK6 are both essential for the activation of MAPK11 and MAPK13 induced by environmental stress, whereas MAP2K6/MKK6 is the major MAPK11 activator in response to TNF. MAP2K6/MKK6 also phosphorylates and activates PAK6. The p38 MAP kinase signal transduction pathway leads to direct activation of transcription factors. Nuclear targets of p38 MAP kinase include the transcription factors ATF2 and ELK1. Within the p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway, MAP3K6/MKK6 mediates phosphorylation of STAT4 through MAPK14 activation, and is therefore required for STAT4 activation and STAT4-regulated gene expression in response to IL-12 stimulation. The pathway is also crucial for IL-6-induced SOCS3 expression and down-regulation of IL-6-mediated gene induction; and for IFNG-dependent gene transcription. Has a role in osteoclast differentiation through NF-kappa-B transactivation by TNFSF11, and in endochondral ossification and since SOX9 is another likely downstream target of the p38 MAPK pathway. MAP2K6/MKK6 mediates apoptotic cell death in thymocytes. Acts also as a regulator for melanocytes dendricity, through the modulation of Rho family GTPases. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10961885, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11727828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15550393, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20869211, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8622669, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8626699, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8663074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9218798}.","MAP2K6","cytoskeleton [GO:0005856]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; MAP kinase kinase activity [GO:0004708]; phosphatase activator activity [GO:0019211]; protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity [GO:0043539]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004713]; apoptotic process [GO:0006915]; bone development [GO:0060348]; cardiac muscle contraction [GO:0060048]; cellular response to sorbitol [GO:0072709]; cellular senescence [GO:0090398]; DNA damage induced protein phosphorylation [GO:0006975]; MAPK cascade [GO:0000165]; negative regulation of cold-induced thermogenesis [GO:0120163]; nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing signaling pathway [GO:0070423]; osteoblast differentiation [GO:0001649]; ovulation cycle process [GO:0022602]; p38MAPK cascade [GO:0038066]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of MAP kinase activity [GO:0043406]; positive regulation of nitric-oxide synthase biosynthetic process [GO:0051770]; positive regulation of prostaglandin secretion [GO:0032308]; regulation of cell cycle [GO:0051726]; regulation of signal transduction by p53 class mediator [GO:1901796]; response to ischemia [GO:0002931]; response to xenobiotic stimulus [GO:0009410]; signal transduction [GO:0007165]; stress-activated MAPK cascade [GO:0051403]","Q5S007; Q16539; Q16236; Q9NRD5; O76024; P52564-1","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9768359}.

Within the complex, enhances DTX3L E3 ligase activity which is further enhanced by PARP9 binding to poly(ADP-ribose) (PubMed:28525742). In association with DTX3L and in presence of E1 and E2 enzymes, mediates NAD(+)-dependent mono-ADP-ribosylation of ubiquitin which prevents ubiquitin conjugation to substrates such as histones (PubMed:28525742). During DNA repair, PARP1 recruits PARP9/BAL1-DTX3L complex to DNA damage sites via PARP9 binding to ribosylated PARP1 (PubMed:23230272).

In response to DNA damage, PARP9-DTX3L complex is required for efficient non-homologous end joining (NHEJ); the complex function is negatively modulated by PARP9 activity (PubMed:28525742).

Involved in cell proliferation and cell growth arrest by positive and negative regulation of the cell cycle. Can promote cell growth by phosphorylating and activating RAF1, which mediates the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade, and/or by up-regulating CDKN1A, which facilitates active cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex formation in glioma cells. In intestinal cells stimulated by the phorbol ester PMA, can trigger a cell cycle arrest program which is associated with the accumulation of the hyper-phosphorylated growth-suppressive form of RB1 and induction of the CDK inhibitors CDKN1A and CDKN1B. Exhibits anti-apoptotic function in glioma cells and protects them from apoptosis by suppressing the p53/TP53-mediated activation of IGFBP3, and in leukemia cells mediates anti-apoptotic action by phosphorylating BCL2. During macrophage differentiation induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1), is translocated to the nucleus and is associated with macrophage development. After wounding, translocates from focal contacts to lamellipodia and participates in the modulation of desmosomal adhesion. Plays a role in cell motility by phosphorylating CSPG4, which induces association of CSPG4 with extensive lamellipodia at the cell periphery and polarization of the cell accompanied by increases in cell motility. During chemokine-induced CD4(+) T cell migration, phosphorylates CDC42-guanine exchange factor DOCK8 resulting in its dissociation from LRCH1 and the activation of GTPase CDC42 (PubMed:28028151). Is highly expressed in a number of cancer cells where it can act as a tumor promoter and is implicated in malignant phenotypes of several tumors such as gliomas and breast cancers. Negatively regulates myocardial contractility and positively regulates angiogenesis, platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in arteries. Mediates hypertrophic growth of neonatal cardiomyocytes, in part through a MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2)-dependent signaling pathway, and upon PMA treatment, is required to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy up to heart failure and death, by increasing protein synthesis, protein-DNA ratio and cell surface area. Regulates cardiomyocyte function by phosphorylating cardiac troponin T (TNNT2/CTNT), which induces significant reduction in actomyosin ATPase activity, myofilament calcium sensitivity and myocardial contractility. In angiogenesis, is required for full endothelial cell migration, adhesion to vitronectin (VTN), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)-dependent regulation of kinase activation and vascular tube formation. Involved in the stabilization of VEGFA mRNA at post-transcriptional level and mediates VEGFA-induced cell proliferation. In the regulation of calcium-induced platelet aggregation, mediates signals from the CD36/GP4 receptor for granule release, and activates the integrin heterodimer ITGA2B-ITGB3 through the RAP1GAP pathway for adhesion. During response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), may regulate selective LPS-induced macrophage functions involved in host defense and inflammation. But in some inflammatory responses, may negatively regulate NF-kappa-B-induced genes, through IL1A-dependent induction of NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA/IKBA). Upon stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), phosphorylates EIF4G1, which modulates EIF4G1 binding to MKNK1 and may be involved in the regulation of EIF4E phosphorylation. Phosphorylates KIT, leading to inhibition of KIT activity. Phosphorylates ATF2 which promotes cooperation between ATF2 and JUN, activating transcription. Phosphorylates SOCS2 at 'Ser-52' facilitating its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P20444, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10848585, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11909826, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12724315, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12832403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15016832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15504744, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15526160, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18056764, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19176525, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21576361, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23990668, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28028151, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9738012, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9830023, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9873035, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9927633}.","PRKCA","alphav-beta3 integrin-PKCalpha complex [GO:0035866]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; mitochondrial membrane [GO:0031966]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:0048471]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; calcium-dependent protein kinase C activity [GO:0004698]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; histone kinase activity (H3-T6 specific) [GO:0035403]; integrin binding [GO:0005178]; protein kinase activity [GO:0004672]; protein kinase C activity [GO:0004697]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]; angiogenesis [GO:0001525]; apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:0097190]; cell adhesion [GO:0007155]; desmosome assembly [GO:0002159]; intracellular signal transduction [GO:0035556]; mitotic nuclear membrane disassembly [GO:0007077]; negative regulation of glial cell apoptotic process [GO:0034351]; peptidyl-serine phosphorylation [GO:0018105]; peptidyl-threonine phosphorylation [GO:0018107]; positive regulation of adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway [GO:0106071]; positive regulation of angiogenesis [GO:0045766]; positive regulation of blood vessel endothelial cell migration [GO:0043536]; positive regulation of bone resorption [GO:0045780]; positive regulation of cardiac muscle hypertrophy [GO:0010613]; positive regulation of cell adhesion [GO:0045785]; positive regulation of cell migration [GO:0030335]; positive regulation of dense core granule biogenesis [GO:2000707]; positive regulation of endothelial cell migration [GO:0010595]; positive regulation of endothelial cell proliferation [GO:0001938]; positive regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade [GO:0070374]; positive regulation of lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0031666]; positive regulation of macrophage differentiation [GO:0045651]; positive regulation of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0045931]; post-translational protein modification [GO:0043687]; protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]; regulation of mRNA stability [GO:0043488]; regulation of platelet aggregation [GO:0090330]; response to interleukin-1 [GO:0070555]","Q15027; Q06481-5; Q66PJ3-4; Q13072; Q8N9N5-2; Q96A33; Q96LY2-2; P15169; P43234; O95424; O43598; P21728; P00533; P60228; Q96J88-3; Q8IVH2-2; Q96NE9-2; O14926; Q06547-3; P19440-3; Q9UJ42; P62805; Q9UBN7; P52597; Q92826; Q02363; Q96FT9-2; P17936; P26951; Q9BYR8; Q9Y234; P51884; Q9H213; P80192; Q15759; A0JLT2-2; Q9H8H3; Q8N983-3; P49821; Q2M1J6; Q9BRX2; Q9Y6X2; P11309-2; Q6P1J6-2; Q9UNA4; Q02156; P07225; Q3YEC7-3; O94844; Q9NWS8-3; Q9ULK6-3; P18077; P31431; Q99643; Q14141; Q01105-2; P37840; Q9Y5X0; P56693; Q9BRW5; O43761; P15884; Q3YBM2; P0CG48; P13051-2; Q8NB14; O95498; Q9NZC7-5; Q9BQ24; Q05CR2; Q8N0Y2-2; O15535; Q24008","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23990668}.

Regulates enzymes: GSK3A/B, PMM2 and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase, and transcription factors: CTNNB1 and nuclear factor NF-kappa-B. Stimulates sodium transport into epithelial cells by enhancing the stability and expression of SCNN1A/ENAC. This is achieved by phosphorylating the NEDD4L ubiquitin E3 ligase, promoting its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, thereby preventing it from binding to SCNN1A/ENAC and targeting it for degradation. Regulates store-operated Ca(+2) entry (SOCE) by stimulating ORAI1 and STIM1. Regulates KCNJ1/ROMK1 directly via its phosphorylation or indirectly via increased interaction with SLC9A3R2/NHERF2. Phosphorylates MDM2 and activates MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53/TP53. Phosphorylates MAPT/TAU and mediates microtubule depolymerization and neurite formation in hippocampal neurons. Phosphorylates SLC2A4/GLUT4 and up-regulates its activity. Phosphorylates APBB1/FE65 and promotes its localization to the nucleus. Phosphorylates MAPK1/ERK2 and activates it by enhancing its interaction with MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Phosphorylates FBXW7 and plays an inhibitory role in the NOTCH1 signaling. Phosphorylates FOXO1 resulting in its relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Phosphorylates FOXO3, promoting its exit from the nucleus and interference with FOXO3-dependent transcription.

Required for protein transport from the Golgi apparatus to the lysosomes by a pathway that is independent of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR). Lysosomal proteins bind specifically to the receptor in the Golgi apparatus and the resulting receptor-ligand complex is transported to an acidic prelysosomal compartment where the low pH mediates the dissociation of the complex (PubMed:16787399). The receptor is then recycled back to the Golgi for another round of trafficking through its binding to the retromer. Also required for protein transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endosomes. Promotes neuronal apoptosis by mediating endocytosis of the proapoptotic precursor forms of BDNF (proBDNF) and NGFB (proNGFB). Also acts as a receptor for neurotensin. May promote mineralization of the extracellular matrix during osteogenic differentiation by scavenging extracellular LPL. Probably required in adipocytes for the formation of specialized storage vesicles containing the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 (GLUT4 storage vesicles, or GSVs). These vesicles provide a stable pool of SLC2A4 and confer increased responsiveness to insulin. May also mediate transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10085125, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11331584, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11390366, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12209882, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12598608, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14657016, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14985763, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15313463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15930396, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15987945, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16787399, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18817523}.","SORT1","cell surface [GO:0009986]; clathrin-coated pit [GO:0005905]; clathrin-coated vesicle [GO:0030136]; cytoplasmic vesicle [GO:0031410]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; early endosome [GO:0005769]; endoplasmic reticulum membrane [GO:0005789]; endosome membrane [GO:0010008]; Golgi apparatus [GO:0005794]; Golgi cisterna membrane [GO:0032580]; integral component of membrane [GO:0016021]; lysosomal membrane [GO:0005765]; lysosome [GO:0005764]; nuclear membrane [GO:0031965]; perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:0048471]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; trans-Golgi network transport vesicle [GO:0030140]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; nerve growth factor binding [GO:0048406]; nerve growth factor receptor activity [GO:0010465]; neurotensin receptor activity, non-G protein-coupled [GO:0030379]; retromer complex binding [GO:1905394]; endocytosis [GO:0006897]; endosome to lysosome transport [GO:0008333]; endosome transport via multivesicular body sorting pathway [GO:0032509]; extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway via death domain receptors [GO:0008625]; G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway [GO:0007186]; glucose import [GO:0046323]; Golgi to endosome transport [GO:0006895]; Golgi to lysosome transport [GO:0090160]; myotube differentiation [GO:0014902]; negative regulation of fat cell differentiation [GO:0045599]; negative regulation of lipoprotein lipase activity [GO:0051005]; neuropeptide signaling pathway [GO:0007218]; neurotrophin TRK receptor signaling pathway [GO:0048011]; ossification [GO:0001503]; plasma membrane to endosome transport [GO:0048227]; post-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport [GO:0006892]; protein targeting to lysosome [GO:0006622]; regulation of gene expression [GO:0010468]; response to insulin [GO:0032868]; vesicle organization [GO:0016050]","Q96K78; P23560-2; Q6PL45-2; Q8TBE1; P26441; Q92520; Q9UJY5; P06280; P28799; P05231; P42702; P30533; P01138; PRO_0000019599 [P01138]; P04629; Q16288; Q8WY21; PRO_0000033162 [Q99523]; P02787; P01266; O95183; Q9UBQ0-2; P83714; P11151; Q9JLC4; P06882; P05067-4","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus, Golgi stack membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16787399, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18817523}; Single-pass type I membrane protein {ECO:0000305}.

Involved in many biological processes, such as bone development, angiogenesis, wound healing, cellular differentiation, chromatin modification and apoptosis (PubMed:1683874, PubMed:7935379, PubMed:9252372, PubMed:27270573). Acts as a protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase by mediating the cross-linking of proteins, such as ACO2, HSPB6, FN1, HMGB1, RAP1GDS1, SLC25A4/ANT1, SPP1 and WDR54 (PubMed:23941696, PubMed:24349085, PubMed:29618516, PubMed:30458214). Under physiological conditions, the protein cross-linking activity is inhibited by GTP; inhibition is relieved by Ca(2+) in response to various stresses (PubMed:7649299, PubMed:7592956, PubMed:18092889). When secreted, catalyzes cross-linking of proteins of the extracellular matrix, such as FN1 and SPP1 resulting in the formation of scaffolds (PubMed:12506096). Plays a key role during apoptosis, both by (1) promoting the cross-linking of cytoskeletal proteins resulting in condensation of the cytoplasm, and by (2) mediating cross-linking proteins of the extracellular matrix, resulting in the irreversible formation of scaffolds that stabilize the integrity of the dying cells before their clearance by phagocytosis, thereby preventing the leakage of harmful intracellular components (PubMed:7935379, PubMed:9252372). In addition to protein cross-linking, can use different monoamine substrates to catalyze a vast array of protein post-translational modifications: mediates aminylation of serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline or histamine into glutamine residues of target proteins to generate protein serotonylation, dopaminylation, noradrenalinylation or histaminylation, respectively (PubMed:23797785, PubMed:30867594). Mediates protein serotonylation of small GTPases during activation and aggregation of platelets, leading to constitutive activation of these GTPases (By similarity). Plays a key role in chromatin organization by mediating serotonylation and dopaminylation of histone H3 (PubMed:30867594, PubMed:32273471). Catalyzes serotonylation of 'Gln-5' of histone H3 (H3Q5ser) during serotonergic neuron differentiation, thereby facilitating transcription (PubMed:30867594). Acts as a mediator of neurotransmission-independent role of nuclear dopamine in ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons: catalyzes dopaminylation of 'Gln-5' of histone H3 (H3Q5dop), thereby regulating relapse-related transcriptional plasticity in the reward system (PubMed:32273471). Regulates vein remodeling by mediating serotonylation and subsequent inactivation of ATP2A2/SERCA2 (By similarity). Also acts as a protein deamidase by mediating the side chain deamidation of specific glutamine residues of proteins to glutamate (PubMed:9623982, PubMed:20547769). Catalyzes specific deamidation of protein gliadin, a component of wheat gluten in the diet (PubMed:9623982). May also act as an isopeptidase cleaving the previously formed cross-links (PubMed:26250429, PubMed:27131890). Also able to participate in signaling pathways independently of its acyltransferase activity: acts as a signal transducer in alpha-1 adrenergic receptor-mediated stimulation of phospholipase C-delta (PLCD) activity and is required for coupling alpha-1 adrenergic agonists to the stimulation of phosphoinositide lipid metabolism (PubMed:8943303). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08587, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P21981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12506096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1683874, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18092889, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20547769, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23797785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23941696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24349085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26250429, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27131890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29618516, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30458214, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30867594, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31991788, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32273471, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7592956, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7649299, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7935379, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8943303, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9252372, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9623982, ECO:0000303|PubMed:27270573}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 2]: Has cytotoxic activity: is able to induce apoptosis independently of its acyltransferase activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17116873}.","TGM2","chromatin [GO:0000785]; collagen-containing extracellular matrix [GO:0062023]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; extracellular matrix [GO:0031012]; focal adhesion [GO:0005925]; intrinsic component of plasma membrane [GO:0031226]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:0048471]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; calcium ion binding [GO:0005509]; GTP binding [GO:0005525]; histone dopaminyltransferase activity [GO:0120297]; histone serotonyltransferase activity [GO:0120295]; peptidase activity [GO:0008233]; peptide histaminyltransferase activity [GO:0120299]; peptide noradrenalinyltransferase activity [GO:0120298]; protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase activity [GO:0003810]; protein-glutamine glutaminase activity [GO:0050568]; apoptotic cell clearance [GO:0043277]; bone development [GO:0060348]; branching involved in salivary gland morphogenesis [GO:0060445]; cellular response to cocaine [GO:0071314]; cellular response to dopamine [GO:1903351]; cellular response to serotonin [GO:1904015]; negative regulation of endoplasmic reticulum calcium ion concentration [GO:0032471]; peptide cross-linking [GO:0018149]; phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway [GO:0007200]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of cell adhesion [GO:0045785]; positive regulation of GTPase activity [GO:0043547]; positive regulation of mitochondrial calcium ion concentration [GO:0051561]; positive regulation of neurogenesis [GO:0050769]; positive regulation of small GTPase mediated signal transduction [GO:0051057]; protein deamination [GO:0018277]; protein homooligomerization [GO:0051260]; proteolysis [GO:0006508]; regulation of apoptotic cell clearance [GO:2000425]; regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0042981]; salivary gland cavitation [GO:0060662]","Q12802; PRO_0000000092 [P05067]; PRO_0000005794 [P39060]; P02751; P08727; PRO_0000018520 [P28300]; Q04206; P40337; G5E9A7; O00429-3; P50570-2; P29692-2; Q06787-7; P04792; P42858; O60333-2; D3DTS7; P60891; Q5T160; Q8N488; Q14141; O95416; Q7Z699; O14656-2; Q86WV8; P02766; Q9NYH9; O76024","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24349085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29618516, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9575137}.

Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may be involved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycle regulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in proteotoxic stress response and cell cycle; Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linked is involved in endocytosis, DNA-damage responses as well as in signaling processes leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B. Linear polymer chains formed via attachment by the initiator Met lead to cell signaling. Ubiquitin is usually conjugated to Lys residues of target proteins, however, in rare cases, conjugation to Cys or Ser residues has been observed.
