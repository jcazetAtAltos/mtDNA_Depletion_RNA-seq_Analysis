Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Required for maximal ATPase activity of SMARCA4/BRG1/BAF190A and for association of the SMARCA4/BRG1/BAF190A containing remodeling complex BAF with chromatin/nuclear matrix. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and is required for the proliferation of neural progenitors. During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity). Component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex which is involved in transcriptional activation of select genes principally by acetylation of nucleosomal histones H4 and H2A. This modification may both alter nucleosome - DNA interactions and promote interaction of the modified histones with other proteins which positively regulate transcription. This complex may be required for the activation of transcriptional programs associated with oncogene and proto-oncogene mediated growth induction, tumor suppressor mediated growth arrest and replicative senescence, apoptosis, and DNA repair.

Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis (PubMed:16581796). AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules (By similarity). AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway (PubMed:19033387). During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (PubMed:23676497). The AP-2 mu subunit binds to transmembrane cargo proteins; it recognizes the Y-X-X-Phi motifs (By similarity). The surface region interacting with to the Y-X-X-Phi motif is inaccessible in cytosolic AP-2, but becomes accessible through a conformational change following phosphorylation of AP-2 mu subunit at Thr-156 in membrane-associated AP-2 (PubMed:11877457). The membrane-specific phosphorylation event appears to involve assembled clathrin which activates the AP-2 mu kinase AAK1 (PubMed:11877457). Plays a role in endocytosis of frizzled family members upon Wnt signaling (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11877457, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12694563, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12952941, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14745134, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14985334, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15473838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16581796, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19033387, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23676497, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31104773}.","AP2M1","AP-2 adaptor complex [GO:0030122]; clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle [GO:0045334]; clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle membrane [GO:0030669]; clathrin-coated pit [GO:0005905]; cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane [GO:0009898]; cytoplasmic vesicle [GO:0031410]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endocytic vesicle membrane [GO:0030666]; endolysosome membrane [GO:0036020]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; glutamatergic synapse [GO:0098978]; lysosomal membrane [GO:0005765]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; postsynapse [GO:0098794]; presynapse [GO:0098793]; clathrin adaptor activity [GO:0035615]; disordered domain specific binding [GO:0097718]; lipid binding [GO:0008289]; low-density lipoprotein particle receptor binding [GO:0050750]; signal sequence binding [GO:0005048]; transmembrane transporter binding [GO:0044325]; clathrin-dependent endocytosis [GO:0072583]; endocytosis [GO:0006897]; intracellular protein transport [GO:0006886]; negative regulation of protein localization to plasma membrane [GO:1903077]; positive regulation of receptor internalization [GO:0002092]; positive regulation of synaptic vesicle endocytosis [GO:1900244]; postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor internalization [GO:0098884]; protein-containing complex assembly [GO:0065003]; receptor internalization [GO:0031623]; regulation of vesicle size [GO:0097494]; synaptic vesicle endocytosis [GO:0048488]; vesicle budding from membrane [GO:0006900]; vesicle-mediated transport [GO:0016192]","Q9BYF1; P63010; Q7Z3C6; P0DPH9; Q96JC9; P00533; Q8N9N8; Q86YD7; P51114; Q99880; Q16778; P62807; Q96MH2; Q1ED39; Q8N8X9; P55081; Q9BU76; Q00013; Q8N3F0; Q9BSU3; Q6ZUT1; Q99633; Q8NAV1; Q9NZ81; Q03393; P35268; Q9UHP6; Q92609; Q96EY4; Q68CQ4; Q9P0T4; PRO_0000037566 [P27958]","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:31104773}.

Involved in a RAD9A-related damage checkpoint, a pathway that is important in determining whether DNA damage is compatible with cell survival or whether it requires cell elimination by apoptosis (PubMed:15983387). Modulates the RAD9A interaction with BCL2 and thereby induces DNA damage-induced apoptosis (PubMed:15983387). Promotes PCNA deubiquitination by recruiting the ubiquitin-specific protease 1 (USP1) and WDR48 thereby down-regulating the error-prone damage bypass pathway (PubMed:20147293). As component of the ATAD5 RFC-like complex, regulates the function of the DNA polymerase processivity factor PCNA by unloading the ring-shaped PCNA homotrimer from DNA after replication during the S phase of the cell cycle (PubMed:23277426, PubMed:23937667). This seems to be dependent on its ATPase activity (PubMed:23277426). Plays important roles in restarting stalled replication forks under replication stress, by unloading the PCNA homotrimer from DNA and recruiting RAD51 possibly through an ATR-dependent manner (PubMed:31844045). Ultimately this enables replication fork regression, breakage, and eventual fork restart (PubMed:31844045). Both the PCNA unloading activity and the interaction with WDR48 are required to efficiently recruit RAD51 to stalled replication forks (PubMed:31844045). Promotes the generation of MUS81-mediated single-stranded DNA-associated breaks in response to replication stress, which is an alternative pathway to restart stalled/regressed replication forks (PubMed:31844045). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15983387, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19755857, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20147293, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23277426, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23937667, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31844045}.","ATAD5","Elg1 RFC-like complex [GO:0031391]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; ATP hydrolysis activity [GO:0016887]; DNA binding [GO:0003677]; DNA clamp unloader activity [GO:0061860]; cell population proliferation [GO:0008283]; intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in response to DNA damage by p53 class mediator [GO:0042771]; isotype switching [GO:0045190]; negative regulation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in response to DNA damage by p53 class mediator [GO:1902166]; nuclear DNA replication [GO:0033260]; nucleic acid phosphodiester bond hydrolysis [GO:0090305]; positive regulation of B cell proliferation [GO:0030890]; positive regulation of cell cycle G2/M phase transition [GO:1902751]; positive regulation of DNA replication [GO:0045740]; positive regulation of isotype switching to IgG isotypes [GO:0048304]; regulation of mitotic cell cycle phase transition [GO:1901990]; signal transduction in response to DNA damage [GO:0042770]","","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19755857, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20147293}.

Binds to asymmetric CRE's as a heterodimer and to palindromic CRE's as a homodimer (By similarity). Core effector of the ISR, which is required for adaptation to various stress such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, amino acid starvation, mitochondrial stress or oxidative stress (PubMed:32132707). During ISR, ATF4 translation is induced via an alternative ribosome translation re-initiation mechanism in response to EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation, and stress-induced ATF4 acts as a master transcription factor of stress-responsive genes in order to promote cell recovery (PubMed:32132706, PubMed:32132707). Promotes the transcription of genes linked to amino acid sufficiency and resistance to oxidative stress to protect cells against metabolic consequences of ER oxidation (By similarity). Activates the transcription of NLRP1, possibly in concert with other factors in response to ER stress (PubMed:26086088). Activates the transcription of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) in response to amino acid deprivation or ER stress (PubMed:11960987). However, when associated with DDIT3/CHOP, the transcriptional activation of the ASNS gene is inhibited in response to amino acid deprivation (PubMed:18940792). Together with DDIT3/CHOP, mediates programmed cell death by promoting the expression of genes involved in cellular amino acid metabolic processes, mRNA translation and the terminal unfolded protein response (terminal UPR), a cellular response that elicits programmed cell death when ER stress is prolonged and unresolved (By similarity). Together with DDIT3/CHOP, activates the transcription of the IRS-regulator TRIB3 and promotes ER stress-induced neuronal cell death by regulating the expression of BBC3/PUMA in response to ER stress (PubMed:15775988). May cooperate with the UPR transcriptional regulator QRICH1 to regulate ER protein homeostasis which is critical for cell viability in response to ER stress (PubMed:33384352). In the absence of stress, ATF4 translation is at low levels and it is required for normal metabolic processes such as embryonic lens formation, fetal liver hematopoiesis, bone development and synaptic plasticity (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of osteoblast differentiation in response to phosphorylation by RPS6KA3/RSK2: phosphorylation in osteoblasts enhances transactivation activity and promotes expression of osteoblast-specific genes and post-transcriptionally regulates the synthesis of Type I collagen, the main constituent of the bone matrix (PubMed:15109498). Cooperates with FOXO1 in osteoblasts to regulate glucose homeostasis through suppression of beta-cell production and decrease in insulin production (By similarity). Activates transcription of SIRT4 (By similarity). Regulates the circadian expression of the core clock component PER2 and the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 (By similarity). Binds in a circadian time-dependent manner to the cAMP response elements (CRE) in the SLC6A4 and PER2 promoters and periodically activates the transcription of these genes (By similarity). Mainly acts as a transcriptional activator in cellular stress adaptation, but it can also act as a transcriptional repressor: acts as a regulator of synaptic plasticity by repressing transcription, thereby inhibiting induction and maintenance of long-term memory (By similarity). Regulates synaptic functions via interaction with DISC1 in neurons, which inhibits ATF4 transcription factor activity by disrupting ATF4 dimerization and DNA-binding (PubMed:31444471). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q06507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11960987, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15109498, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15775988, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16682973, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17684156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18940792, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26086088, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31444471, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32132706, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32132707, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33384352}.;

The CPC complex has essential functions at the centromere in ensuring correct chromosome alignment and segregation and is required for chromatin-induced microtubule stabilization and spindle assembly (PubMed:11516652, PubMed:12925766, PubMed:14610074, PubMed:14722118, PubMed:26829474). Involved in the bipolar attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores and is a key regulator for the onset of cytokinesis during mitosis (PubMed:15249581). Required for central/midzone spindle assembly and cleavage furrow formation (PubMed:12458200, PubMed:12686604). Key component of the cytokinesis checkpoint, a process required to delay abscission to prevent both premature resolution of intercellular chromosome bridges and accumulation of DNA damage: phosphorylates CHMP4C, leading to retain abscission-competent VPS4 (VPS4A and/or VPS4B) at the midbody ring until abscission checkpoint signaling is terminated at late cytokinesis (PubMed:22422861, PubMed:24814515). AURKB phosphorylates the CPC complex subunits BIRC5/survivin, CDCA8/borealin and INCENP (PubMed:11516652, PubMed:12925766, PubMed:14610074). Phosphorylation of INCENP leads to increased AURKB activity (PubMed:11516652, PubMed:12925766, PubMed:14610074). Other known AURKB substrates involved in centromeric functions and mitosis are CENPA, DES/desmin, GPAF, KIF2C, NSUN2, RACGAP1, SEPTIN1, VIM/vimentin, HASPIN, and histone H3 (PubMed:11784863, PubMed:12689593, PubMed:14602875, PubMed:11856369, PubMed:16103226, PubMed:21658950, PubMed:11756469). A positive feedback loop involving HASPIN and AURKB contributes to localization of CPC to centromeres (PubMed:21658950). Phosphorylation of VIM controls vimentin filament segregation in cytokinetic process, whereas histone H3 is phosphorylated at 'Ser-10' and 'Ser-28' during mitosis (H3S10ph and H3S28ph, respectively) (PubMed:11784863, PubMed:11856369). A positive feedback between HASPIN and AURKB contributes to CPC localization (PubMed:21658950). AURKB is also required for kinetochore localization of BUB1 and SGO1 (PubMed:15020684, PubMed:17617734). Phosphorylation of p53/TP53 negatively regulates its transcriptional activity (PubMed:20959462). Key regulator of active promoters in resting B- and T-lymphocytes: acts by mediating phosphorylation of H3S28ph at active promoters in resting B-cells, inhibiting RNF2/RING1B-mediated ubiquitination of histone H2A and enhancing binding and activity of the USP16 deubiquitinase at transcribed genes (By similarity). Acts as an inhibitor of CGAS during mitosis: catalyzes phosphorylation of the N-terminus of CGAS during the G2-M transition, blocking CGAS liquid phase separation and activation, and thereby preventing CGAS-induced autoimmunity (PubMed:33542149). Phosphorylates KRT5 during anaphase and telophase (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O70126, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11516652, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11756469, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11784863, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11856369, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12458200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12686604, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12689593, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12925766, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14602875, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14610074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14722118, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15020684, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15249581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16103226, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17617734, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21658950, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22422861, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24814515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26829474, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33542149}.","AURKB","chromocenter [GO:0010369]; chromosome passenger complex [GO:0032133]; condensed chromosome, centromeric region [GO:0000779]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; kinetochore [GO:0000776]; microtubule cytoskeleton [GO:0015630]; midbody [GO:0030496]; mitotic spindle midzone [GO:1990023]; mitotic spindle pole [GO:0097431]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; spindle [GO:0005819]; spindle microtubule [GO:0005876]; spindle midzone [GO:0051233]; spindle pole centrosome [GO:0031616]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; histone serine kinase activity [GO:0035174]; kinase binding [GO:0019900]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004712]; abscission [GO:0009838]; aging [GO:0007568]; attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochore [GO:0008608]; cell population proliferation [GO:0008283]; cellular response to UV [GO:0034644]; cleavage furrow formation [GO:0036089]; histone modification [GO:0016570]; mitotic cell cycle [GO:0000278]; mitotic cytokinesis [GO:0000281]; mitotic cytokinesis checkpoint signaling [GO:0044878]; mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint signaling [GO:0007094]; mitotic spindle midzone assembly [GO:0051256]; mitotic spindle organization [GO:0007052]; negative regulation of B cell apoptotic process [GO:0002903]; negative regulation of cytokinesis [GO:0032466]; negative regulation of protein binding [GO:0032091]; negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0000122]; positive regulation of attachment of mitotic spindle microtubules to kinetochore [GO:1902425]; positive regulation of cytokinesis [GO:0032467]; positive regulation of lateral attachment of mitotic spindle microtubules to kinetochore [GO:1905116]; positive regulation of mitotic cell cycle spindle assembly checkpoint [GO:0090267]; positive regulation of mitotic cytokinesis [GO:1903490]; positive regulation of mitotic sister chromatid segregation [GO:0062033]; positive regulation of mitotic sister chromatid separation [GO:1901970]; positive regulation of protein phosphorylation [GO:0001934]; positive regulation of telomerase activity [GO:0051973]; positive regulation of telomere capping [GO:1904355]; positive regulation of telomere maintenance via telomerase [GO:0032212]; post-translational protein modification [GO:0043687]; protein autophosphorylation [GO:0046777]; protein localization to kinetochore [GO:0034501]; protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]; regulation of chromosome segregation [GO:0051983]; regulation of cytokinesis [GO:0032465]; regulation of signal transduction by p53 class mediator [GO:1901796]; spindle organization [GO:0007051]","O15392; O15392-1; O15392-2; Q16543; Q53HL2; Q86XJ1; Q16695; P08238; Q9NQS7; Q9NQS7-1; Q92993; Q15691; P06748; P30153; Q8WYJ6; O75410-6; Q99986","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462}.

Has a key role in the assembly of checkpoint proteins at the kinetochore, being required for the subsequent localization of CENPF, BUB1B, CENPE and MAD2L1. Required for the kinetochore localization of PLK1. Required for centromeric enrichment of AUKRB in prometaphase. Plays an important role in defining SGO1 localization and thereby affects sister chromatid cohesion. Acts as a substrate for anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) in complex with its activator CDH1 (APC/C-Cdh1). Necessary for ensuring proper chromosome segregation and binding to BUB3 is essential for this function. Can regulate chromosome segregation in a kinetochore-independent manner. Can phosphorylate BUB3. The BUB1-BUB3 complex plays a role in the inhibition of APC/C when spindle-assembly checkpoint is activated and inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of APC/C by phosphorylating its activator CDC20. This complex can also phosphorylate MAD1L1. Kinase activity is essential for inhibition of APC/CCDC20 and for chromosome alignment but does not play a major role in the spindle-assembly checkpoint activity. Mediates cell death in response to chromosome missegregation and acts to suppress spontaneous tumorigenesis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10198256, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15020684, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15525512, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15723797, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16760428, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17158872, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19487456, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20739936}.","BUB1","cytosol [GO:0005829]; intracellular membrane-bounded organelle [GO:0043231]; kinetochore [GO:0000776]; membrane [GO:0016020]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; protein kinase activity [GO:0004672]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; apoptotic process [GO:0006915]; cell division [GO:0051301]; cell population proliferation [GO:0008283]; meiotic sister chromatid cohesion, centromeric [GO:0051754]; mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint signaling [GO:0007094]; protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]; regulation of chromosome segregation [GO:0051983]; regulation of sister chromatid cohesion [GO:0007063]","O95376; O60566; O43684; P46108; Q8NG31; Q8NG31-2; P03070","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.

Activated by direct binding to LPS without the need of an upstream sensor (PubMed:25119034). Involved in NLRP6 inflammasome-dependent activation in response to lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a cell-wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, which leads to CASP1 activation and IL1B and IL18 secretion (PubMed:33377178). Independently of NLRP3 inflammasome and CASP1, promotes pyroptosis, through GSDMD cleavage and activation, followed by IL1A, IL18 and HMGB1 release in response to non-canonical inflammasome activators (PubMed:26375003, PubMed:32109412). Plays a crucial role in the restriction of Salmonella typhimurium replication in colonic epithelial cells during infection: in later stages of the infection, LPS from cytosolic Salmonella triggers CASP4 activation, which catalyzes cleavage of GSDMD, resulting in pyroptosis of infected cells and their extrusion into the gut lumen, as well as in IL18 secretion (PubMed:25121752, PubMed:26375003, PubMed:25964352, PubMed:34671164, PubMed:32109412). Cleavage of GSDMD is not strictly dependent on the consensus cleavage site but depends on an exosite interface on CASP4 that recognizes and binds the Gasdermin-D, C-terminal (GSDMD-CT) part (PubMed:32109412). Pyroptosis limits bacterial replication, while cytokine secretion promotes the recruitment and activation of immune cells and triggers mucosal inflammation (PubMed:25121752, PubMed:26375003, PubMed:25964352).

Phosphorylates CTNNB1, USP37, p53/TP53, NPM1, CDK7, RB1, BRCA2, MYC, NPAT, EZH2. Triggers duplication of centrosomes and DNA. Acts at the G1-S transition to promote the E2F transcriptional program and the initiation of DNA synthesis, and modulates G2 progression; controls the timing of entry into mitosis/meiosis by controlling the subsequent activation of cyclin B/CDK1 by phosphorylation, and coordinates the activation of cyclin B/CDK1 at the centrosome and in the nucleus. Crucial role in orchestrating a fine balance between cellular proliferation, cell death, and DNA repair in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Activity of CDK2 is maximal during S phase and G2; activated by interaction with cyclin E during the early stages of DNA synthesis to permit G1-S transition, and subsequently activated by cyclin A2 (cyclin A1 in germ cells) during the late stages of DNA replication to drive the transition from S phase to mitosis, the G2 phase. EZH2 phosphorylation promotes H3K27me3 maintenance and epigenetic gene silencing. Phosphorylates CABLES1 (By similarity). Cyclin E/CDK2 prevents oxidative stress-mediated Ras-induced senescence by phosphorylating MYC. Involved in G1-S phase DNA damage checkpoint that prevents cells with damaged DNA from initiating mitosis; regulates homologous recombination-dependent repair by phosphorylating BRCA2, this phosphorylation is low in S phase when recombination is active, but increases as cells progress towards mitosis. In response to DNA damage, double-strand break repair by homologous recombination a reduction of CDK2-mediated BRCA2 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of RB1 disturbs its interaction with E2F1. NPM1 phosphorylation by cyclin E/CDK2 promotes its dissociates from unduplicated centrosomes, thus initiating centrosome duplication. Cyclin E/CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of NPAT at G1-S transition and until prophase stimulates the NPAT-mediated activation of histone gene transcription during S phase. Required for vitamin D-mediated growth inhibition by being itself inactivated. Involved in the nitric oxide- (NO) mediated signaling in a nitrosylation/activation-dependent manner. USP37 is activated by phosphorylation and thus triggers G1-S transition. CTNNB1 phosphorylation regulates insulin internalization. Phosphorylates FOXP3 and negatively regulates its transcriptional activity and protein stability (By similarity). Phosphorylates CDK2AP2 (PubMed:12944431). Phosphorylates ERCC6 which is essential for its chromatin remodeling activity at DNA double-strand breaks (PubMed:29203878). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97377, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10499802, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10884347, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10995386, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10995387, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11051553, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11113184, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12944431, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15800615, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17495531, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18372919, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19966300, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20079829, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20147522, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20195506, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20935635, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21262353, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21319273, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21596315, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28666995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29203878}.","CDK2","Cajal body [GO:0015030]; centrosome [GO:0005813]; chromosome, telomeric region [GO:0000781]; condensed chromosome [GO:0000793]; cyclin A1-CDK2 complex [GO:0097123]; cyclin A2-CDK2 complex [GO:0097124]; cyclin E1-CDK2 complex [GO:0097134]; cyclin E2-CDK2 complex [GO:0097135]; cyclin-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme complex [GO:0000307]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endosome [GO:0005768]; male germ cell nucleus [GO:0001673]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; transcription regulator complex [GO:0005667]; X chromosome [GO:0000805]; Y chromosome [GO:0000806]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; cyclin binding [GO:0030332]; cyclin-dependent protein kinase activity [GO:0097472]; cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004693]; magnesium ion binding [GO:0000287]; protein domain specific binding [GO:0019904]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; cell division [GO:0051301]; cellular response to nitric oxide [GO:0071732]; cellular senescence [GO:0090398]; centriole replication [GO:0007099]; centrosome duplication [GO:0051298]; DNA repair [GO:0006281]; DNA replication [GO:0006260]; DNA-templated transcription [GO:0006351]; G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0000082]; G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0000086]; meiotic cell cycle [GO:0051321]; mitotic G1 DNA damage checkpoint signaling [GO:0031571]; negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0000122]; peptidyl-serine phosphorylation [GO:0018105]; positive regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0008284]; positive regulation of DNA-templated DNA replication initiation [GO:0032298]; positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription [GO:0045893]; positive regulation of heterochromatin assembly [GO:0031453]; potassium ion transport [GO:0006813]; protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]; Ras protein signal transduction [GO:0007265]; regulation of anaphase-promoting complex-dependent catabolic process [GO:1905784]; regulation of G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0010389]; regulation of gene expression [GO:0010468]; signal transduction [GO:0007165]","P20248; O95067; P24385; P24864; O96020; P51946; P50613; P38936; P46527; Q16667; P61024; Q09472; Q969H0-4; P22607; Q14957; P06396; P01112; Q9Y6K9; O95835; Q8TD08; P06400; Q9BY12; Q9UQR0; Q9UQR0-1; Q9UBI4; Q96PU4; P30274; P51943; P03129; Q08619","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, microtubule organizing center, centrosome.

Drives chromosome congression (alignment of chromosomes at the spindle equator resulting in the formation of the metaphase plate) by mediating the lateral sliding of polar chromosomes along spindle microtubules towards the spindle equator and by aiding the establishment and maintenance of connections between kinetochores and spindle microtubules (PubMed:7889940, PubMed:23891108, PubMed:25395579). The transport of pole-proximal chromosomes towards the spindle equator is favored by microtubule tracks that are detyrosinated (PubMed:25908662). Acts as a processive bi-directional tracker of dynamic microtubule tips; after chromosomes have congressed, continues to play an active role at kinetochores, enhancing their links with dynamic microtubule ends (PubMed:23955301). Suppresses chromosome congression in NDC80-depleted cells and contributes positively to congression only when microtubules are stabilized (PubMed:25743205). Plays an important role in the formation of stable attachments between kinetochores and spindle microtubules (PubMed:17535814) The stabilization of kinetochore-microtubule attachment also requires CENPE-dependent localization of other proteins to the kinetochore including BUB1B, MAD1 and MAD2. Plays a role in spindle assembly checkpoint activation (SAC) via its interaction with BUB1B resulting in the activation of its kinase activity, which is important for activating SAC. Necessary for the mitotic checkpoint signal at individual kinetochores to prevent aneuploidy due to single chromosome loss (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q6RT24, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17535814, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23891108, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23955301, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25395579, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25743205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25908662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7889940}.","CENPE","chromosome [GO:0005694]; chromosome, centromeric region [GO:0000775]; condensed chromosome, centromeric region [GO:0000779]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; intercellular bridge [GO:0045171]; intracellular membrane-bounded organelle [GO:0043231]; kinetochore [GO:0000776]; kinetochore microtubule [GO:0005828]; membrane [GO:0016020]; microtubule [GO:0005874]; microtubule cytoskeleton [GO:0015630]; midbody [GO:0030496]; mitotic spindle [GO:0072686]; mitotic spindle midzone [GO:1990023]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; spindle midzone [GO:0051233]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; kinetochore binding [GO:0043515]; microtubule binding [GO:0008017]; microtubule motor activity [GO:0003777]; plus-end-directed microtubule motor activity [GO:0008574]; attachment of mitotic spindle microtubules to kinetochore [GO:0051315]; cell division [GO:0051301]; chromosome segregation [GO:0007059]; kinetochore assembly [GO:0051382]; lateral attachment of mitotic spindle microtubules to kinetochore [GO:0099607]; metaphase plate congression [GO:0051310]; microtubule plus-end directed mitotic chromosome migration [GO:0099606]; microtubule-based movement [GO:0007018]; mitotic cell cycle [GO:0000278]; mitotic chromosome movement towards spindle pole [GO:0007079]; mitotic metaphase plate congression [GO:0007080]; mitotic spindle organization [GO:0007052]; positive regulation of protein kinase activity [GO:0045860]; regulation of mitotic metaphase/anaphase transition [GO:0030071]","O60566; Q9Y6D9; Q9BZD4","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Chromosome, centromere, kinetochore {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17535814, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18374647, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18460473, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25395579, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25918224, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9763420}.

MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and mostly are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins, such as stimulated growth factor receptors, lysosomal enzymes and lipids. The MVB pathway appears to require the sequential function of ESCRT-O, -I,-II and -III complexes. ESCRT-III proteins mostly dissociate from the invaginating membrane before the ILV is released. The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the terminal stages of cytokinesis and the budding of enveloped viruses (HIV-1 and other lentiviruses). Key component of the cytokinesis checkpoint, a process required to delay abscission to prevent both premature resolution of intercellular chromosome bridges and accumulation of DNA damage: upon phosphorylation by AURKB, together with ZFYVE19/ANCHR, retains abscission-competent VPS4 (VPS4A and/or VPS4B) at the midbody ring until abscission checkpoint signaling is terminated at late cytokinesis. Deactivation of AURKB results in dephosphorylation of CHMP4C followed by its dissociation from ANCHR and VPS4 and subsequent abscission (PubMed:22422861, PubMed:24814515). ESCRT-III proteins are believed to mediate the necessary vesicle extrusion and/or membrane fission activities, possibly in conjunction with the AAA ATPase VPS4.

Part of the L-cysteine derived from the trans-sulfuration pathway is utilized for biosynthesis of the ubiquitous antioxidant glutathione (PubMed:18476726). Besides its role in the conversion of L-cystathionine into L-cysteine, it utilizes L-cysteine and L-homocysteine as substrates (at much lower rates than L,L-cystathionine) to produce the endogenous gaseous signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (PubMed:10212249, PubMed:19261609, PubMed:19961860, PubMed:19019829). In vitro, it converts two L-cysteine molecules into lanthionine and H2S, also two L-homocysteine molecules to homolanthionine and H2S, which can be particularly relevant under conditions of severe hyperhomocysteinemia (which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease) (PubMed:19261609). Lanthionine and homolanthionine are structural homologs of L,L-cystathionine that differ by the absence or presence of an extra methylene group, respectively (PubMed:19261609). Acts as a cysteine-protein sulfhydrase by mediating sulfhydration of target proteins: sulfhydration consists of converting -SH groups into -SSH on specific cysteine residues of target proteins such as GAPDH, PTPN1 and NF-kappa-B subunit RELA, thereby regulating their function (PubMed:22169477). By generating the gasotransmitter H2S, it participates in a number of physiological processes such as vasodilation, bone protection, and inflammation (Probable) (PubMed:29254196). Plays an essential role in myogenesis by contributing to the biogenesis of H2S in skeletal muscle tissue (By similarity). Can also accept homoserine as substrate (By similarity). Catalyzes the elimination of selenocystathionine (which can be derived from the diet) to yield selenocysteine, ammonia and 2-oxobutanoate (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P18757, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8VCN5, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10212249, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18476726, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19019829, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19261609, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19961860, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22169477, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29254196, ECO:0000303|PubMed:18476726, ECO:0000305|PubMed:18476726, ECO:0000305|PubMed:19019829}.","CTH","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; calmodulin binding [GO:0005516]; carbon-sulfur lyase activity [GO:0016846]; cystathionine gamma-lyase activity [GO:0004123]; homocysteine desulfhydrase activity [GO:0047982]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; L-cysteine desulfhydrase activity [GO:0080146]; L-cystine L-cysteine-lyase (deaminating) [GO:0044540]; pyridoxal phosphate binding [GO:0030170]; selenocystathionine gamma-lyase activity [GO:0098606]; cellular response to leukemia inhibitory factor [GO:1990830]; cysteine biosynthetic process [GO:0019344]; cysteine biosynthetic process via cystathionine [GO:0019343]; cysteine metabolic process [GO:0006534]; endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response [GO:0030968]; hydrogen sulfide biosynthetic process [GO:0070814]; lipid metabolic process [GO:0006629]; negative regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:2001234]; positive regulation of aortic smooth muscle cell differentiation [GO:1904831]; positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling [GO:0043123]; positive regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity [GO:0051092]; protein homotetramerization [GO:0051289]; protein sulfhydration [GO:0044524]; protein-pyridoxal-5-phosphate linkage via peptidyl-N6-pyridoxal phosphate-L-lysine [GO:0018272]; transsulfuration [GO:0019346]","P32929; Q96NT3; Q96NT3-2; Q96HA8; Q6P9E2","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.","ENST00000346806.2 [P32929-2];ENST00000370938.8 [P32929-1];ENST00000411986.6 [P32929-3];",0.00040852881862132

Can bind and assemble clathrin, and binds simultaneously to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and cargos containing non-phosphorylated NPXY internalization motifs, such as the LDL receptor, to recruit them to clathrin-coated pits. Can function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis independently of the AP-2 complex. Involved in endocytosis of integrin beta-1; this function seems to redundant with the AP-2 complex and seems to require DAB2 binding to endocytosis accessory EH domain-containing proteins such as EPS15, EPS15L1 and ITSN1. Involved in endocytosis of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator/CFTR. Involved in endocytosis of megalin/LRP2 lipoprotein receptor during embryonal development. Required for recycling of the TGF-beta receptor. Involved in CFTR trafficking to the late endosome. Involved in several receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Involved in TGF-beta receptor signaling and facilitates phosphorylation of the signal transducer SMAD2. Mediates TFG-beta-stimulated JNK activation. May inhibit the canoniocal Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway by stabilizing the beta-catenin destruction complex through a competing association with axin preventing its dephosphorylation through protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Sequesters LRP6 towards clathrin-mediated endocytosis, leading to inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. May activate non-canonical Wnt signaling. In cell surface growth factor/Ras signaling pathways proposed to inhibit ERK activation by interrupting the binding of GRB2 to SOS1 and to inhibit SRC by preventing its activating phosphorylation at 'Tyr-419'. Proposed to be involved in modulation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling mediated by SRC activation; seems to compete with AR for interaction with SRC. Plays a role in the CSF-1 signal transduction pathway. Plays a role in cellular differentiation. Involved in cell positioning and formation of visceral endoderm (VE) during embryogenesis and proposed to be required in the VE to respond to Nodal signaling coming from the epiblast.

Functions in part via its role in ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal protein degradation. Functions downstream of ATM and phosphorylates p53/TP53 at 'Ser-46', and thereby contributes to the induction of apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Phosphorylates NFATC1, and thereby inhibits its accumulation in the nucleus and its transcription factor activity. Phosphorylates EIF2B5 at 'Ser-544', enabling its subsequent phosphorylation and inhibition by GSK3B. Likewise, phosphorylation of NFATC1, CRMP2/DPYSL2 and CRMP4/DPYSL3 promotes their subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3B. May play a general role in the priming of GSK3 substrates. Inactivates GYS1 by phosphorylation at 'Ser-641', and potentially also a second phosphorylation site, thus regulating glycogen synthesis. Mediates EDVP E3 ligase complex formation and is required for the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of KATNA1. Phosphorylates TERT at 'Ser-457', promoting TERT ubiquitination by the EDVP complex. Phosphorylates SIAH2, and thereby increases its ubiquitin ligase activity. Promotes the proteasomal degradation of MYC and JUN, and thereby regulates progress through the mitotic cell cycle and cell proliferation. Promotes proteasomal degradation of GLI2 and GLI3, and thereby plays a role in smoothened and sonic hedgehog signaling. Plays a role in cytoskeleton organization and neurite outgrowth via its phosphorylation of DCX and DPYSL2. Phosphorylates CRMP2/DPYSL2, CRMP4/DPYSL3, DCX, EIF2B5, EIF4EBP1, GLI2, GLI3, GYS1, JUN, MDM2, MYC, NFATC1, p53/TP53, TAU/MAPT and KATNA1.

Dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinases (DYRKs) autophosphorylate a critical tyrosine residue in their activation loop and phosphorylate their substrate on serine and threonine residues (PubMed:9748265, PubMed:29634919). Acts as a central dissolvase of membraneless organelles during the G2-to-M transition, after the nuclear-envelope breakdown: acts by mediating phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in unstructured domains of proteins, such as SRRM1 and PCM1 (PubMed:29973724). Does not mediate disassembly of all membraneless organelles: disassembly of P-body and nucleolus is not regulated by DYRK3 (PubMed:29973724). Dissolution of membraneless organelles at the onset of mitosis is also required to release mitotic regulators, such as ZNF207, from liquid-unmixed organelles where they are sequestered and keep them dissolved during mitosis (PubMed:29973724). Regulates mTORC1 by mediating the dissolution of stress granules: during stressful conditions, DYRK3 partitions from the cytosol to the stress granule, together with mTORC1 components, which prevents mTORC1 signaling (PubMed:23415227). When stress signals are gone, the kinase activity of DYRK3 is required for the dissolution of stress granule and mTORC1 relocation to the cytosol: acts by mediating the phosphorylation of the mTORC1 inhibitor AKT1S1, allowing full reactivation of mTORC1 signaling (PubMed:23415227). Also acts as a negative regulator of EPO-dependent erythropoiesis: may place an upper limit on red cell production during stress erythropoiesis (PubMed:10779429). Inhibits cell death due to cytokine withdrawal in hematopoietic progenitor cells (PubMed:10779429).

Component of the centralspindlin complex that serves as a microtubule-dependent and Rho-mediated signaling required for the myosin contractile ring formation during the cell cycle cytokinesis. Regulates the translocation of RHOA from the central spindle to the equatorial region. Plays a role in the control of mitotic spindle assembly; regulates the activation of CDC42 in metaphase for the process of spindle fibers attachment to kinetochores before chromosome congression. Involved in the regulation of epithelial cell polarity; participates in the formation of epithelial tight junctions in a polarity complex PARD3-PARD6-protein kinase PRKCQ-dependent manner. Plays a role in the regulation of neurite outgrowth. Inhibits phenobarbital (PB)-induced NR1I3 nuclear translocation. Stimulates the activity of RAC1 through its association with the oncogenic PARD6A-PRKCI complex in cancer cells, thereby acting to coordinately drive tumor cell proliferation and invasion. Also stimulates genotoxic stress-induced RHOB activity in breast cancer cells leading to their cell death. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10579713, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14645260, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15254234, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15545273, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15642749, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16103226, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16170345, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16236794, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16495035, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19129481, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19468300, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19617897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21189248, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21373644, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25068414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31888991}.","ECT2","bicellular tight junction [GO:0005923]; cell cortex [GO:0005938]; cell-cell junction [GO:0005911]; centralspindlin complex [GO:0097149]; cleavage furrow [GO:0032154]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; midbody [GO:0030496]; mitotic spindle [GO:0072686]; nuclear body [GO:0016604]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; GTPase activator activity [GO:0005096]; guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity [GO:0005085]; protein homodimerization activity [GO:0042803]; small GTPase binding [GO:0031267]; activation of GTPase activity [GO:0090630]; activation of protein kinase activity [GO:0032147]; bicellular tight junction assembly [GO:0070830]; cell differentiation [GO:0030154]; cell morphogenesis [GO:0000902]; cellular response to calcium ion [GO:0071277]; cellular response to hydrogen peroxide [GO:0070301]; cellular response to ionizing radiation [GO:0071479]; intracellular signal transduction [GO:0035556]; mitotic cytokinesis [GO:0000281]; nervous system development [GO:0007399]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of cytokinesis [GO:0032467]; positive regulation of GTPase activity [GO:0043547]; positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling [GO:0043123]; positive regulation of neuron differentiation [GO:0045666]; positive regulation of protein import into nucleus [GO:0042307]; protein homooligomerization [GO:0051260]; protein transport [GO:0015031]; regulation of attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochore [GO:0051988]; regulation of cytokinesis, actomyosin contractile ring assembly [GO:2000431]; regulation of protein kinase activity [GO:0045859]; regulation of small GTPase mediated signal transduction [GO:0051056]","P12830; P35221; Q02241; P16333; O00444; Q9H0H5","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10579713, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14645260, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15254234, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16103226, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16495035, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19617897}.

Isoforms can be differently regulated and may play an important role in maintaining the plasticity at glutamatergic synapses (PubMed:9808459). Required for normal hearing (PubMed:25816005). Negatively regulates T cell activation by inhibiting the calcineurin-NFAT pathway. Acts by competing with calcineurin/PPP3CA for NFAT protein binding, hence preventing NFAT activation by PPP3CA (PubMed:18218901). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18218901, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25816005, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9808459}.","HOMER2","anchoring junction [GO:0070161]; apical part of cell [GO:0045177]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; dendrite [GO:0030425]; glutamatergic synapse [GO:0098978]; intracellular organelle [GO:0043229]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; postsynaptic density [GO:0014069]; stereocilium tip [GO:0032426]; actin binding [GO:0003779]; G protein-coupled glutamate receptor binding [GO:0035256]; synaptic receptor adaptor activity [GO:0030160]; behavioral response to cocaine [GO:0048148]; calcium-mediated signaling using intracellular calcium source [GO:0035584]; chemical homeostasis within a tissue [GO:0048875]; G protein-coupled glutamate receptor signaling pathway [GO:0007216]; negative regulation of calcineurin-NFAT signaling cascade [GO:0070885]; negative regulation of interleukin-2 production [GO:0032703]; regulation of G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway [GO:0008277]; regulation of store-operated calcium entry [GO:2001256]; sensory perception of sound [GO:0007605]","Q9BRK4; Q9H4P4; Q9P2A4; Q8WX93-2","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25816005}.

Phosphorylation of IRSs proteins lead to the activation of two main signaling pathways: the PI3K-AKT/PKB pathway and the Ras-MAPK pathway. The result of activating the MAPK pathway is increased cellular proliferation, whereas activating the PI3K pathway inhibits apoptosis and stimulates protein synthesis. Phosphorylated IRS1 can activate the 85 kDa regulatory subunit of PI3K (PIK3R1), leading to activation of several downstream substrates, including protein AKT/PKB. AKT phosphorylation, in turn, enhances protein synthesis through mTOR activation and triggers the antiapoptotic effects of IGFIR through phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD. In parallel to PI3K-driven signaling, recruitment of Grb2/SOS by phosphorylated IRS1 or Shc leads to recruitment of Ras and activation of the ras-MAPK pathway. In addition to these two main signaling pathways IGF1R signals also through the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway (JAK/STAT). Phosphorylation of JAK proteins can lead to phosphorylation/activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins. In particular activation of STAT3, may be essential for the transforming activity of IGF1R. The JAK/STAT pathway activates gene transcription and may be responsible for the transforming activity. JNK kinases can also be activated by the IGF1R. IGF1 exerts inhibiting activities on JNK activation via phosphorylation and inhibition of MAP3K5/ASK1, which is able to directly associate with the IGF1R.; FUNCTION: When present in a hybrid receptor with INSR, binds IGF1. PubMed:12138094 shows that hybrid receptors composed of IGF1R and INSR isoform Long are activated with a high affinity by IGF1, with low affinity by IGF2 and not significantly activated by insulin, and that hybrid receptors composed of IGF1R and INSR isoform Short are activated by IGF1, IGF2 and insulin. In contrast, PubMed:16831875 shows that hybrid receptors composed of IGF1R and INSR isoform Long and hybrid receptors composed of IGF1R and INSR isoform Short have similar binding characteristics, both bind IGF1 and have a low affinity for insulin.","IGF1R","alphav-beta3 integrin-IGF-1-IGF1R complex [GO:0035867]; axon [GO:0030424]; caveola [GO:0005901]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; insulin receptor complex [GO:0005899]; integral component of plasma membrane [GO:0005887]; intracellular membrane-bounded organelle [GO:0043231]; membrane [GO:0016020]; neuronal cell body [GO:0043025]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; protein kinase complex [GO:1902911]; receptor complex [GO:0043235]; T-tubule [GO:0030315]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; G-protein alpha-subunit binding [GO:0001965]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; insulin binding [GO:0043559]; insulin receptor activity [GO:0005009]; insulin receptor binding [GO:0005158]; insulin receptor substrate binding [GO:0043560]; insulin-like growth factor binding [GO:0005520]; insulin-like growth factor I binding [GO:0031994]; insulin-like growth factor receptor activity [GO:0005010]; phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase binding [GO:0043548]; protein transporter activity [GO:0140318]; protein tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004713]; structural molecule activity [GO:0005198]; transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004714]; aging [GO:0007568]; amyloid-beta clearance [GO:0097242]; axonogenesis [GO:0007409]; cardiac atrium development [GO:0003230]; cellular response to aldosterone [GO:1904045]; cellular response to amyloid-beta [GO:1904646]; cellular response to angiotensin [GO:1904385]; cellular response to dexamethasone stimulus [GO:0071549]; cellular response to estradiol stimulus [GO:0071392]; cellular response to glucose stimulus [GO:0071333]; cellular response to insulin-like growth factor stimulus [GO:1990314]; cellular response to mechanical stimulus [GO:0071260]; cellular response to progesterone stimulus [GO:0071393]; cellular response to testosterone stimulus [GO:0071394]; cellular response to transforming growth factor beta stimulus [GO:0071560]; cellular response to zinc ion starvation [GO:0034224]; cellular senescence [GO:0090398]; cerebellum development [GO:0021549]; dendritic spine maintenance [GO:0097062]; establishment of cell polarity [GO:0030010]; estrous cycle [GO:0044849]; glucose homeostasis [GO:0042593]; hippocampus development [GO:0021766]; immune response [GO:0006955]; insulin receptor signaling pathway [GO:0008286]; insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway [GO:0048009]; negative regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043066]; negative regulation of cholangiocyte apoptotic process [GO:1904193]; negative regulation of hepatocyte apoptotic process [GO:1903944]; negative regulation of MAPK cascade [GO:0043409]; negative regulation of muscle cell apoptotic process [GO:0010656]; peptidyl-tyrosine autophosphorylation [GO:0038083]; phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling [GO:0014065]; phosphatidylinositol-mediated signaling [GO:0048015]; positive regulation of axon regeneration [GO:0048680]; positive regulation of cell migration [GO:0030335]; positive regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0008284]; positive regulation of cold-induced thermogenesis [GO:0120162]; positive regulation of cytokinesis [GO:0032467]; positive regulation of DNA metabolic process [GO:0051054]; positive regulation of kinase activity [GO:0033674]; positive regulation of MAPK cascade [GO:0043410]; positive regulation of osteoblast proliferation [GO:0033690]; positive regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling [GO:0014068]; positive regulation of protein kinase B signaling [GO:0051897]; positive regulation of protein-containing complex disassembly [GO:0043243]; positive regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation [GO:0048661]; positive regulation of steroid hormone biosynthetic process [GO:0090031]; protein autophosphorylation [GO:0046777]; regulation of JNK cascade [GO:0046328]; response to ethanol [GO:0045471]; response to L-glutamate [GO:1902065]; response to nicotine [GO:0035094]; response to vitamin E [GO:0033197]; signal transduction [GO:0007165]; transcytosis [GO:0045056]; transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway [GO:0007169]","Q9NZN5; PRO_0000004724 [P49913]; P41240; P35222; P05019; P08069; P06213; P05556; Q9Y2W7; Q9UJU2; P27986; O00459; P35813; P18031; Q06124; P29350; P29353-2; Q01995; Q64010; P01317","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17524361}; Single-pass type I membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17524361}.","ENST00000650285.1;",0.000129492613939689

Upon binding to R-spondins (RSPO1, RSPO2, RSPO3 or RSPO4), associates with phosphorylated LRP6 and frizzled receptors that are activated by extracellular Wnt receptors, triggering the canonical Wnt signaling pathway to increase expression of target genes. In contrast to classical G-protein coupled receptors, does not activate heterotrimeric G-proteins to transduce the signal. Its function as activator of the Wnt signaling pathway is required for the development of various organs, including liver, kidney, intestine, bone, reproductive tract and eye. May also act as a receptor for norrin (NDP), such results however require additional confirmation in vivo. Required during spermatogenesis to activate the Wnt signaling pathway in peritubular myoid cells. Required for the maintenance of intestinal stem cells and Paneth cell differentiation in postnatal intestinal crypts. Acts as a regulator of bone formation and remodeling. Involved in kidney development; required for maintaining the ureteric bud in an undifferentiated state. Involved in the development of the anterior segment of the eye. Required during erythropoiesis. Also acts as a negative regulator of innate immunity by inhibiting TLR2/TLR4 associated pattern-recognition and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Plays an important role in regulating the circadian rhythms of plasma lipids, partially through regulating the rhythmic expression of MTTP (By similarity).

With MAP3K3/MKK3, catalyzes the concomitant phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in the MAP kinases p38 MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and MAPK14 and plays an important role in the regulation of cellular responses to cytokines and all kinds of stresses. Especially, MAP2K3/MKK3 and MAP2K6/MKK6 are both essential for the activation of MAPK11 and MAPK13 induced by environmental stress, whereas MAP2K6/MKK6 is the major MAPK11 activator in response to TNF. MAP2K6/MKK6 also phosphorylates and activates PAK6. The p38 MAP kinase signal transduction pathway leads to direct activation of transcription factors. Nuclear targets of p38 MAP kinase include the transcription factors ATF2 and ELK1. Within the p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway, MAP3K6/MKK6 mediates phosphorylation of STAT4 through MAPK14 activation, and is therefore required for STAT4 activation and STAT4-regulated gene expression in response to IL-12 stimulation. The pathway is also crucial for IL-6-induced SOCS3 expression and down-regulation of IL-6-mediated gene induction; and for IFNG-dependent gene transcription. Has a role in osteoclast differentiation through NF-kappa-B transactivation by TNFSF11, and in endochondral ossification and since SOX9 is another likely downstream target of the p38 MAPK pathway. MAP2K6/MKK6 mediates apoptotic cell death in thymocytes. Acts also as a regulator for melanocytes dendricity, through the modulation of Rho family GTPases. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10961885, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11727828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15550393, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20869211, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8622669, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8626699, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8663074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9218798}.","MAP2K6","cytoskeleton [GO:0005856]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; MAP kinase kinase activity [GO:0004708]; phosphatase activator activity [GO:0019211]; protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity [GO:0043539]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004713]; apoptotic process [GO:0006915]; bone development [GO:0060348]; cardiac muscle contraction [GO:0060048]; cellular response to sorbitol [GO:0072709]; cellular senescence [GO:0090398]; DNA damage induced protein phosphorylation [GO:0006975]; MAPK cascade [GO:0000165]; negative regulation of cold-induced thermogenesis [GO:0120163]; nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing signaling pathway [GO:0070423]; osteoblast differentiation [GO:0001649]; ovulation cycle process [GO:0022602]; p38MAPK cascade [GO:0038066]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of MAP kinase activity [GO:0043406]; positive regulation of nitric-oxide synthase biosynthetic process [GO:0051770]; positive regulation of prostaglandin secretion [GO:0032308]; regulation of cell cycle [GO:0051726]; regulation of signal transduction by p53 class mediator [GO:1901796]; response to ischemia [GO:0002931]; response to xenobiotic stimulus [GO:0009410]; signal transduction [GO:0007165]; stress-activated MAPK cascade [GO:0051403]","Q5S007; Q16539; Q16236; Q9NRD5; O76024; P52564-1","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9768359}.

Regulates many physiological processes including proliferation, scattering, morphogenesis and survival. Ligand binding at the cell surface induces autophosphorylation of MET on its intracellular domain that provides docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. Following activation by ligand, interacts with the PI3-kinase subunit PIK3R1, PLCG1, SRC, GRB2, STAT3 or the adapter GAB1. Recruitment of these downstream effectors by MET leads to the activation of several signaling cascades including the RAS-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, or PLCgamma-PKC. The RAS-ERK activation is associated with the morphogenetic effects while PI3K/AKT coordinates prosurvival effects. During embryonic development, MET signaling plays a role in gastrulation, development and migration of muscles and neuronal precursors, angiogenesis and kidney formation. In adults, participates in wound healing as well as organ regeneration and tissue remodeling. Promotes also differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells.

The CBC complex is involved in mRNA export from the nucleus via its interaction with ALYREF/THOC4/ALY, leading to the recruitment of the mRNA export machinery to the 5' end of mRNA and to mRNA export in a 5' to 3' direction through the nuclear pore. The CBC complex is also involved in mediating U snRNA and intronless mRNAs export from the nucleus. The CBC complex is essential for a pioneer round of mRNA translation, before steady state translation when the CBC complex is replaced by cytoplasmic cap-binding protein eIF4E. The pioneer round of mRNA translation mediated by the CBC complex plays a central role in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), NMD only taking place in mRNAs bound to the CBC complex, but not on eIF4E-bound mRNAs. The CBC complex enhances NMD in mRNAs containing at least one exon-junction complex (EJC) via its interaction with UPF1, promoting the interaction between UPF1 and UPF2. The CBC complex is also involved in 'failsafe' NMD, which is independent of the EJC complex, while it does not participate in Staufen-mediated mRNA decay (SMD). During cell proliferation, the CBC complex is also involved in microRNAs (miRNAs) biogenesis via its interaction with SRRT/ARS2, thereby being required for miRNA-mediated RNA interference. The CBC complex also acts as a negative regulator of PARN, thereby acting as an inhibitor of mRNA deadenylation. In the CBC complex, NCBP2/CBP20 recognizes and binds capped RNAs (m7GpppG-capped RNA) but requires NCBP1/CBP80 to stabilize the movement of its N-terminal loop and lock the CBC into a high affinity cap-binding state with the cap structure. The conventional cap-binding complex with NCBP2 binds both small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and messenger (mRNA) and is involved in their export from the nucleus (PubMed:26382858). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11551508, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15361857, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17190602, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17363367, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17873884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18369367, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19632182, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26382858}.","NCBP2","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; mRNA cap binding complex [GO:0005845]; nuclear cap binding complex [GO:0005846]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; RNA cap binding complex [GO:0034518]; DNA binding [GO:0003677]; mRNA binding [GO:0003729]; RNA 7-methylguanosine cap binding [GO:0000340]; RNA binding [GO:0003723]; RNA cap binding [GO:0000339]; snRNA binding [GO:0017069]; alternative mRNA splicing, via spliceosome [GO:0000380]; cap-dependent translational initiation [GO:0002191]; histone mRNA metabolic process [GO:0008334]; miRNA-mediated gene silencing [GO:0035195]; mRNA 3'-end processing [GO:0031124]; mRNA cis splicing, via spliceosome [GO:0045292]; mRNA export from nucleus [GO:0006406]; mRNA splicing, via spliceosome [GO:0000398]; mRNA transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0042789]; nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process, nonsense-mediated decay [GO:0000184]; positive regulation of mRNA 3'-end processing [GO:0031442]; positive regulation of phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain [GO:1901409]; positive regulation of RNA export from nucleus [GO:0046833]; positive regulation of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II [GO:0032968]; pre-mRNA cleavage required for polyadenylation [GO:0098789]; primary miRNA processing [GO:0031053]; regulation of translational initiation [GO:0006446]; RNA splicing [GO:0008380]; snRNA export from nucleus [GO:0006408]","Q9BRK4; Q09161; Q14974-1; Q09161","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:8601613}.

Actively mediates genome-wide epigenetic and transcriptional changes through hypomethylation of repressive chromatin marks, such as H3K27me3 (PubMed:26571212, PubMed:23455543, PubMed:31043742). In a developmental context, contributes to low levels of the repressive histone marks that characterize pluripotent embryonic stem cell pre-implantation state (PubMed:26571212). Acts as a metabolic regulator primarily on white adipose tissue energy expenditure as well as hepatic gluconeogenesis and cholesterol biosynthesis. In white adipocytes, regulates polyamine flux by consuming S-adenosyl-L-methionine which provides for propylamine group in polyamine biosynthesis, whereas by consuming nicotinamide controls NAD(+) levels through the salvage pathway (By similarity).

Mediates glutamate, aspartate or serine ADP-ribosylation of proteins: the ADP-D-ribosyl group of NAD(+) is transferred to the acceptor carboxyl group of target residues and further ADP-ribosyl groups are transferred to the 2'-position of the terminal adenosine moiety, building up a polymer with an average chain length of 20-30 units (PubMed:25043379, PubMed:30104678, PubMed:30321391). Serine ADP-ribosylation of proteins constitutes the primary form of ADP-ribosylation of proteins in response to DNA damage (PubMed:32939087). Mediates glutamate and aspartate ADP-ribosylation of target proteins in absence of HPF1 (PubMed:25043379). Following interaction with HPF1, catalyzes serine ADP-ribosylation of target proteins; HPF1 conferring serine specificity by completing the PARP2 active site (PubMed:28190768, PubMed:32028527, PubMed:34486521, PubMed:34874266, PubMed:34108479). PARP2 initiates the repair of double-strand DNA breaks: recognizes and binds DNA breaks within chromatin and recruits HPF1, licensing serine ADP-ribosylation of target proteins, such as histones, thereby promoting decompaction of chromatin and the recruitment of repair factors leading to the reparation of DNA strand breaks (PubMed:10364231, PubMed:32939087, PubMed:34108479). HPF1 initiates serine ADP-ribosylation but restricts the polymerase activity of PARP2 in order to limit the length of poly-ADP-ribose chains (PubMed:34732825, PubMed:34795260). Specifically mediates formation of branched poly-ADP-ribosylation (PubMed:30104678). Branched poly-ADP-ribose chains are specifically recognized by some factors, such as APLF (PubMed:30104678). In addition to proteins, also able to ADP-ribosylate DNA: preferentially acts on 5'-terminal phosphates at DNA strand breaks termini in nicked duplex (PubMed:27471034, PubMed:29361132). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10364231, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25043379, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27471034, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28190768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29361132, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30104678, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30321391, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32028527, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32939087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34108479, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34486521, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34732825, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34795260, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34874266}.","PARP2","nucleolus [GO:0005730]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; site of DNA damage [GO:0090734]; chromatin binding [GO:0003682]; damaged DNA binding [GO:0003684]; NAD DNA ADP-ribosyltransferase activity [GO:0140294]; NAD+ ADP-ribosyltransferase activity [GO:0003950]; NAD+- protein-aspartate ADP-ribosyltransferase activity [GO:0140806]; NAD+-protein ADP-ribosyltransferase activity [GO:1990404]; NAD+-protein-glutamate ADP-ribosyltransferase activity [GO:0140807]; NAD+-protein-serine ADP-ribosyltransferase activity [GO:0140805]; nucleosome binding [GO:0031491]; poly-ADP-D-ribose binding [GO:0072572]; base-excision repair [GO:0006284]; decidualization [GO:0046697]; DNA ADP-ribosylation [GO:0030592]; DNA repair [GO:0006281]; double-strand break repair [GO:0006302]; extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:0097191]; histone modification [GO:0016570]; negative regulation of neuron death [GO:1901215]; positive regulation of cell growth involved in cardiac muscle cell development [GO:0061051]; protein ADP-ribosylation [GO:0006471]; protein auto-ADP-ribosylation [GO:0070213]; protein poly-ADP-ribosylation [GO:0070212]","Q00688; Q99469","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10364231, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26704974}.

The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 or ARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1, NR1D2, RORA, RORB and RORG, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1 transcription, respectively. Has a redundant role with the other PER proteins PER1 and PER2 and is not essential for the circadian rhythms maintenance. In contrast, plays an important role in sleep-wake timing and sleep homeostasis probably through the transcriptional regulation of sleep homeostasis-related genes, without influencing circadian parameters. Can bind heme. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17346965, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19716732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24439663, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24577121, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26903630}.","PER3","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; kinase binding [GO:0019900]; transcription cis-regulatory region binding [GO:0000976]; transcription corepressor binding [GO:0001222]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]; circadian regulation of gene expression [GO:0032922]; entrainment of circadian clock by photoperiod [GO:0043153]; negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0000122]; protein stabilization [GO:0050821]; regulation of circadian sleep/wake cycle, sleep [GO:0045187]","O96017","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26903630}.

MMEJ is an error-prone repair pathway that produces deletions of sequences from the strand being repaired and promotes genomic rearrangements, such as telomere fusions, some of them leading to cellular transformation (PubMed:25642963, PubMed:25643323). POLQ acts as an inhibitor of homology-recombination repair (HR) pathway by limiting RAD51 accumulation at resected ends (PubMed:25642963). POLQ-mediated MMEJ may be required to promote the survival of cells with a compromised HR repair pathway, thereby preventing genomic havoc by resolving unrepaired lesions (By similarity). The polymerase acts by binding directly the 2 ends of resected double-strand breaks, allowing microhomologous sequences in the overhangs to form base pairs. It then extends each strand from the base-paired region using the opposing overhang as a template. Requires partially resected DNA containing 2 to 6 base pairs of microhomology to perform MMEJ (PubMed:25643323). The polymerase activity is highly promiscuous: unlike most polymerases, promotes extension of ssDNA and partial ssDNA (pssDNA) substrates (PubMed:18503084, PubMed:21050863, PubMed:22135286). Also exhibits low-fidelity DNA synthesis, translesion synthesis and lyase activity, and it is implicated in interstrand-cross-link repair, base excision repair and DNA end-joining (PubMed:14576298, PubMed:18503084, PubMed:19188258, PubMed:24648516).

During the S phase of the cell cycle, the DNA polymerase alpha complex (composed of a catalytic subunit POLA1, an accessory subunit POLA2 and two primase subunits, the catalytic subunit PRIM1 and the regulatory subunit PRIM2) is recruited to DNA at the replicative forks via direct interactions with MCM10 and WDHD1 (By similarity). The primase subunit of the polymerase alpha complex initiates DNA synthesis by oligomerising short RNA primers on both leading and lagging strands (PubMed:17893144). These primers are initially extended by the polymerase alpha catalytic subunit and subsequently transferred to polymerase delta and polymerase epsilon for processive synthesis on the lagging and leading strand, respectively (By similarity). In the primase complex, both subunits are necessary for the initial di-nucleotide formation, but the extension of the primer depends only on the catalytic subunit (PubMed:17893144, PubMed:25550159).

Involved in cell proliferation and cell growth arrest by positive and negative regulation of the cell cycle. Can promote cell growth by phosphorylating and activating RAF1, which mediates the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade, and/or by up-regulating CDKN1A, which facilitates active cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex formation in glioma cells. In intestinal cells stimulated by the phorbol ester PMA, can trigger a cell cycle arrest program which is associated with the accumulation of the hyper-phosphorylated growth-suppressive form of RB1 and induction of the CDK inhibitors CDKN1A and CDKN1B. Exhibits anti-apoptotic function in glioma cells and protects them from apoptosis by suppressing the p53/TP53-mediated activation of IGFBP3, and in leukemia cells mediates anti-apoptotic action by phosphorylating BCL2. During macrophage differentiation induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1), is translocated to the nucleus and is associated with macrophage development. After wounding, translocates from focal contacts to lamellipodia and participates in the modulation of desmosomal adhesion. Plays a role in cell motility by phosphorylating CSPG4, which induces association of CSPG4 with extensive lamellipodia at the cell periphery and polarization of the cell accompanied by increases in cell motility. During chemokine-induced CD4(+) T cell migration, phosphorylates CDC42-guanine exchange factor DOCK8 resulting in its dissociation from LRCH1 and the activation of GTPase CDC42 (PubMed:28028151). Is highly expressed in a number of cancer cells where it can act as a tumor promoter and is implicated in malignant phenotypes of several tumors such as gliomas and breast cancers. Negatively regulates myocardial contractility and positively regulates angiogenesis, platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in arteries. Mediates hypertrophic growth of neonatal cardiomyocytes, in part through a MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2)-dependent signaling pathway, and upon PMA treatment, is required to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy up to heart failure and death, by increasing protein synthesis, protein-DNA ratio and cell surface area. Regulates cardiomyocyte function by phosphorylating cardiac troponin T (TNNT2/CTNT), which induces significant reduction in actomyosin ATPase activity, myofilament calcium sensitivity and myocardial contractility. In angiogenesis, is required for full endothelial cell migration, adhesion to vitronectin (VTN), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)-dependent regulation of kinase activation and vascular tube formation. Involved in the stabilization of VEGFA mRNA at post-transcriptional level and mediates VEGFA-induced cell proliferation. In the regulation of calcium-induced platelet aggregation, mediates signals from the CD36/GP4 receptor for granule release, and activates the integrin heterodimer ITGA2B-ITGB3 through the RAP1GAP pathway for adhesion. During response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), may regulate selective LPS-induced macrophage functions involved in host defense and inflammation. But in some inflammatory responses, may negatively regulate NF-kappa-B-induced genes, through IL1A-dependent induction of NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA/IKBA). Upon stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), phosphorylates EIF4G1, which modulates EIF4G1 binding to MKNK1 and may be involved in the regulation of EIF4E phosphorylation. Phosphorylates KIT, leading to inhibition of KIT activity. Phosphorylates ATF2 which promotes cooperation between ATF2 and JUN, activating transcription.

In HeLa cells, contributes to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced cell migration, and in human corneal epithelial cells, plays a critical role in wound healing after activation by HGF. During cytokinesis, forms a complex with YWHAB, which is crucial for daughter cell separation, and facilitates abscission by a mechanism which may implicate the regulation of RHOA. In cardiac myocytes, regulates myofilament function and excitation coupling at the Z-lines, where it is indirectly associated with F-actin via interaction with COPB1.

Functions as an E3 ligase for oxidized IREB2 and both heme and oxygen are necessary for IREB2 ubiquitination (PubMed:12629548). Promotes ubiquitination of TAB2 and IRF3 and their degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:17449468, PubMed:18711448). Component of the LUBAC complex which conjugates linear ('Met-1'-linked) polyubiquitin chains to substrates and plays a key role in NF-kappa-B activation and regulation of inflammation (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181, PubMed:19136968). LUBAC conjugates linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and RIPK1 and is involved in activation of the canonical NF-kappa-B and the JNK signaling pathways (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181, PubMed:19136968). Linear ubiquitination mediated by the LUBAC complex interferes with TNF-induced cell death and thereby prevents inflammation (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181). LUBAC is recruited to the TNF-R1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC) following polyubiquitination of TNF-RSC components by BIRC2 and/or BIRC3 and to conjugate linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and possibly other components contributing to the stability of the complex (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181, PubMed:19136968). The LUBAC complex is also involved in innate immunity by conjugating linear polyubiquitin chains at the surface of bacteria invading the cytosol to form the ubiquitin coat surrounding bacteria (PubMed:28481331). LUBAC is not able to initiate formation of the bacterial ubiquitin coat, and can only promote formation of linear polyubiquitins on pre-existing ubiquitin (PubMed:28481331). The bacterial ubiquitin coat acts as an 'eat-me' signal for xenophagy and promotes NF-kappa-B activation (PubMed:28481331). Together with OTULIN, the LUBAC complex regulates the canonical Wnt signaling during angiogenesis (PubMed:23708998).

NF-kappa-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NFKB1/p105, NFKB1/p50, REL and NFKB2/p52. The dimers bind at kappa-B sites in the DNA of their target genes and the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different kappa-B sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. Different dimer combinations act as transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively. NF-kappa-B is controlled by various mechanisms of post-translational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. NF-kappa-B complexes are held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state complexed with members of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor (I-kappa-B) family. In a conventional activation pathway, I-kappa-B is phosphorylated by I-kappa-B kinases (IKKs) in response to different activators, subsequently degraded thus liberating the active NF-kappa-B complex which translocates to the nucleus. NF-kappa-B heterodimeric RelB-p50 and RelB-p52 complexes are transcriptional activators. RELB neither associates with DNA nor with RELA/p65 or REL. Stimulates promoter activity in the presence of NFKB2/p49. As a member of the NUPR1/RELB/IER3 survival pathway, may provide pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with remarkable resistance to cell stress, such as starvation or gemcitabine treatment.

It prevents their reannealing and in parallel, recruits and activates different proteins and complexes involved in DNA metabolism. Thereby, it plays an essential role both in DNA replication and the cellular response to DNA damage. In the cellular response to DNA damage, the RPA complex controls DNA repair and DNA damage checkpoint activation. Through recruitment of ATRIP activates the ATR kinase a master regulator of the DNA damage response. It is required for the recruitment of the DNA double-strand break repair factors RAD51 and RAD52 to chromatin in response to DNA damage. Also recruits to sites of DNA damage proteins like XPA and XPG that are involved in nucleotide excision repair and is required for this mechanism of DNA repair. Also plays a role in base excision repair (BER) probably through interaction with UNG. Also recruits SMARCAL1/HARP, which is involved in replication fork restart, to sites of DNA damage.

The small ribosomal subunit (SSU) binds messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and translates the encoded message by selecting cognate aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The large subunit (LSU) contains the ribosomal catalytic site termed the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), which catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds, thereby polymerizing the amino acids delivered by tRNAs into a polypeptide chain. The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome through a tunnel in the LSU and interact with protein factors that function in enzymatic processing, targeting, and the membrane insertion of nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel. As part of the 5S RNP/5S ribonucleoprotein particle it is an essential component of the LSU, required for its formation and the maturation of rRNAs (PubMed:12962325, PubMed:19061985, PubMed:24120868, PubMed:23636399). It also couples ribosome biogenesis to p53/TP53 activation.

Has endonuclease activity and plays a role in repair of damaged DNA (PubMed:7775413). Cleaves phosphodiester bonds of DNAs containing altered bases with broad specificity and cleaves supercoiled DNA more efficiently than relaxed DNA (PubMed:15707971). Displays high binding affinity for 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), a common DNA lesion caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (PubMed:14706345). Has also been shown to bind with similar affinity to intact and damaged DNA (PubMed:18610840). Stimulates the N-glycosylase activity of the base excision protein OGG1 (PubMed:15518571). Enhances the uracil excision activity of UNG1 (PubMed:18973764). Also stimulates the cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone by APEX1 (PubMed:18973764). When located in the mitochondrion, reduces cellular ROS levels and mitochondrial DNA damage (PubMed:23911537). Has also been shown to negatively regulate DNA repair in cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide (PubMed:17049931). Plays a role in regulating transcription as part of the NF-kappa-B p65-p50 complex where it binds to the RELA/p65 subunit, enhances binding of the complex to DNA and promotes transcription of target genes (PubMed:18045535). Represses its own translation by binding to its cognate mRNA (PubMed:20217897). Binds to and protects TP53/p53 from MDM2-mediated ubiquitination (PubMed:19656744). Involved in spindle formation and chromosome movement during mitosis by regulating microtubule polymerization (PubMed:23131551). Involved in induction of apoptosis through its role in activation of CASP8 (PubMed:14988002). Induces neuronal apoptosis by interacting with the E2F1 transcription factor and acting synergistically with it to up-regulate pro-apoptotic proteins BCL2L11/BIM and HRK/Dp5 (PubMed:20605787). Interacts with TRADD following exposure to UV radiation and induces apoptosis by caspase-dependent JNK activation (PubMed:22510408). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14706345, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14988002, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15518571, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15707971, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17049931, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18045535, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18610840, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18973764, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19656744, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20217897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20605787, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22510408, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23131551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23911537, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7775413, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8706699}.","RPS3","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; cytosolic ribosome [GO:0022626]; cytosolic small ribosomal subunit [GO:0022627]; endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; focal adhesion [GO:0005925]; membrane [GO:0016020]; mitochondrial inner membrane [GO:0005743]; mitochondrial matrix [GO:0005759]; mitotic spindle [GO:0072686]; NF-kappaB complex [GO:0071159]; nucleolus [GO:0005730]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; polysome [GO:0005844]; postsynaptic density [GO:0014069]; ribonucleoprotein complex [GO:1990904]; ribosome [GO:0005840]; ruffle membrane [GO:0032587]; class I DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) endonuclease activity [GO:0140078]; damaged DNA binding [GO:0003684]; DNA binding [GO:0003677]; DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) endonuclease activity [GO:0003906]; DNA-binding transcription factor binding [GO:0140297]; endodeoxyribonuclease activity [GO:0004520]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; Hsp70 protein binding [GO:0030544]; Hsp90 protein binding [GO:0051879]; iron-sulfur cluster binding [GO:0051536]; kinase binding [GO:0019900]; microtubule binding [GO:0008017]; mRNA binding [GO:0003729]; oxidized purine DNA binding [GO:0032357]; oxidized pyrimidine DNA binding [GO:0032358]; protein kinase A binding [GO:0051018]; protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]; protein-containing complex binding [GO:0044877]; RNA binding [GO:0003723]; small ribosomal subunit rRNA binding [GO:0070181]; structural constituent of ribosome [GO:0003735]; supercoiled DNA binding [GO:0097100]; tubulin binding [GO:0015631]; ubiquitin-like protein conjugating enzyme binding [GO:0044390]; apoptotic process [GO:0006915]; cell division [GO:0051301]; cellular response to DNA damage stimulus [GO:0006974]; cellular response to hydrogen peroxide [GO:0070301]; cellular response to reactive oxygen species [GO:0034614]; cellular response to tumor necrosis factor [GO:0071356]; chromosome segregation [GO:0007059]; cytoplasmic translation [GO:0002181]; DNA repair [GO:0006281]; negative regulation of DNA repair [GO:0045738]; negative regulation of protein ubiquitination [GO:0031397]; negative regulation of translation [GO:0017148]; positive regulation of activated T cell proliferation [GO:0042104]; positive regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:2001235]; positive regulation of base-excision repair [GO:1905053]; positive regulation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in execution phase of apoptosis [GO:2001272]; positive regulation of DNA N-glycosylase activity [GO:1902546]; positive regulation of DNA repair [GO:0045739]; positive regulation of endodeoxyribonuclease activity [GO:0032079]; positive regulation of gene expression [GO:0010628]; positive regulation of interleukin-2 production [GO:0032743]; positive regulation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in response to DNA damage [GO:1902231]; positive regulation of JUN kinase activity [GO:0043507]; positive regulation of microtubule polymerization [GO:0031116]; positive regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity [GO:0051092]; positive regulation of NIK/NF-kappaB signaling [GO:1901224]; positive regulation of protein-containing complex assembly [GO:0031334]; positive regulation of T cell receptor signaling pathway [GO:0050862]; regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0042981]; response to TNF agonist [GO:0061481]; spindle assembly [GO:0051225]; translation [GO:0006412]; translational initiation [GO:0006413]","P42858; O14920; Q5S007; Q96GA3; Q00987; Q15843; P19838; P25963; Q08752; Q04206; P04637; P63104","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16314389, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17289661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17560175, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18045535, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20217897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21871177}.

Cycles between the cytoplasmic-open state (c-state) and the matrix-open state (m-state): operates by the alternating access mechanism with a single substrate-binding site intermittently exposed to either the cytosolic (c-state) or matrix (m-state) side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (By similarity). In addition to its ADP:ATP antiporter activity, also involved in mitochondrial uncoupling and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) activity (By similarity). Plays a role in mitochondrial uncoupling by acting as a proton transporter: proton transport uncouples the proton flows via the electron transport chain and ATP synthase to reduce the efficiency of ATP production and cause mitochondrial thermogenesis (By similarity). Proton transporter activity is inhibited by ADP:ATP antiporter activity, suggesting that SLC25A5/ANT2 acts as a master regulator of mitochondrial energy output by maintaining a delicate balance between ATP production (ADP:ATP antiporter activity) and thermogenesis (proton transporter activity) (By similarity). Proton transporter activity requires free fatty acids as cofactor, but does not transport it (By similarity). Probably mediates mitochondrial uncoupling in tissues that do not express UCP1 (By similarity). Also plays a key role in mPTP opening, a non-specific pore that enables free passage of the mitochondrial membranes to solutes of up to 1.5 kDa, and which contributes to cell death (PubMed:31883789). It is however unclear if SLC25A5/ANT2 constitutes a pore-forming component of mPTP or regulates it (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of mitophagy independently of ADP:ATP antiporter activity: promotes mitophagy via interaction with TIMM44, leading to inhibit the presequence translocase TIMM23, thereby promoting stabilization of PINK1 (By similarity). As part of the mitotic spindle-associated MMXD complex it may play a role in chromosome segregation (PubMed:20797633). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:G2QNH0, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P51881, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20797633, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31883789}.","SLC25A5","integral component of plasma membrane [GO:0005887]; membrane [GO:0016020]; mitochondrial inner membrane [GO:0005743]; mitochondrial nucleoid [GO:0042645]; mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex [GO:0005757]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; MMXD complex [GO:0071817]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; adenine nucleotide transmembrane transporter activity [GO:0000295]; adenine transmembrane transporter activity [GO:0015207]; ATP:ADP antiporter activity [GO:0005471]; oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler activity [GO:0017077]; RNA binding [GO:0003723]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]; adaptive thermogenesis [GO:1990845]; adenine nucleotide transport [GO:0051503]; B cell differentiation [GO:0030183]; chromosome segregation [GO:0007059]; erythrocyte differentiation [GO:0030218]; mitochondrial ADP transmembrane transport [GO:0140021]; mitochondrial ATP transmembrane transport [GO:1990544]; negative regulation of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization involved in apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:1901029]; positive regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0008284]; positive regulation of mitophagy [GO:1901526]; regulation of mitochondrial membrane permeability [GO:0046902]","Q7Z695; Q5S007; Q9Y6E7; Q8N357","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion inner membrane {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P02722}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000255}.

Specifically binds the 5'-ACAAAG-3' DNA motif present in enhancers and super-enhancers and promotes expression of genes important for chondrogenesis, including cartilage matrix protein-coding genes COL2A1, COL4A2, COL9A1, COL11A2 and ACAN, SOX5 and SOX6 (PubMed:8640233). Also binds to some promoter regions (By similarity). Plays a central role in successive steps of chondrocyte differentiation (By similarity). Absolutely required for precartilaginous condensation, the first step in chondrogenesis during which skeletal progenitors differentiate into prechondrocytes (By similarity). Together with SOX5 and SOX6, required for overt chondrogenesis when condensed prechondrocytes differentiate into early stage chondrocytes, the second step in chondrogenesis (By similarity). Later, required to direct hypertrophic maturation and block osteoblast differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes: maintains chondrocyte columnar proliferation, delays prehypertrophy and then prevents osteoblastic differentiation of chondrocytes by lowering beta-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling and RUNX2 expression (By similarity). Also required for chondrocyte hypertrophy, both indirectly, by keeping the lineage fate of chondrocytes, and directly, by remaining present in upper hypertrophic cells and transactivating COL10A1 along with MEF2C (By similarity). Low lipid levels are the main nutritional determinant for chondrogenic commitment of skeletal progenitor cells: when lipids levels are low, FOXO (FOXO1 and FOXO3) transcription factors promote expression of SOX9, which induces chondrogenic commitment and suppresses fatty acid oxidation (By similarity). Mechanistically, helps, but is not required, to remove epigenetic signatures of transcriptional repression and deposit active promoter and enhancer marks at chondrocyte-specific genes (By similarity). Acts in cooperation with the Hedgehog pathway-dependent GLI (GLI1 and GLI3) transcription factors (By similarity). In addition to cartilage development, also acts as a regulator of proliferation and differentiation in epithelial stem/progenitor cells: involved in the lung epithelium during branching morphogenesis, by balancing proliferation and differentiation and regulating the extracellular matrix (By similarity). Controls epithelial branching during kidney development (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q04887, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24038782, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8640233}.","SOX9","chromatin [GO:0000785]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654];

May regulate the activation of NFKB1 by TNF-alpha, nerve growth factor (NGF) and interleukin-1. May play a role in titin/TTN downstream signaling in muscle cells. May regulate signaling cascades through ubiquitination. Adapter that mediates the interaction between TRAF6 and CYLD (By similarity). May be involved in cell differentiation, apoptosis, immune response and regulation of K(+) channels. Involved in endosome organization by retaining vesicles in the perinuclear cloud: following ubiquitination by RNF26, attracts specific vesicle-associated adapters, forming a molecular bridge that restrains cognate vesicles in the perinuclear region and organizes the endosomal pathway for efficient cargo transport (PubMed:27368102). Promotes relocalization of 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitinated STING1 to autophagosomes (PubMed:29496741). Acts as an activator of the NFE2L2/NRF2 pathway via interaction with KEAP1: interaction inactivates the BCR(KEAP1) complex, promoting nuclear accumulation of NFE2L2/NRF2 and subsequent expression of cytoprotective genes (PubMed:20452972, PubMed:28380357, PubMed:33393215). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08623, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q64337, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10356400, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10747026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11244088, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12471037, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340068, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15802564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15911346, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15953362, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16079148, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16286508, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19931284, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20168092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20452972, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22622177, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24128730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27368102, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28380357, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28404643, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29496741, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33393215}.","SQSTM1","aggresome [GO:0016235]; amphisome [GO:0044753]; autolysosome [GO:0044754]; autophagosome [GO:0005776]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; inclusion body [GO:0016234]; intracellular membrane-bounded organelle [GO:0043231]; late endosome [GO:0005770]; Lewy body [GO:0097413]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; P-body [GO:0000932]; phagophore assembly site [GO:0000407]; PML body [GO:0016605]; sarcomere [GO:0030017]; sperm midpiece [GO:0097225]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; ionotropic glutamate receptor binding [GO:0035255]; K63-linked polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding [GO:0070530]; protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]; protein kinase C binding [GO:0005080]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein-containing complex binding [GO:0044877]; receptor tyrosine kinase binding [GO:0030971]; SH2 domain binding [GO:0042169]; ubiquitin binding [GO:0043130]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]; zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]; aggrephagy [GO:0035973]; apoptotic process [GO:0006915]; autophagy [GO:0006914]; autophagy of mitochondrion [GO:0000422]; brown fat cell proliferation [GO:0070342]; cell differentiation [GO:0030154]; endosomal transport [GO:0016197]; endosome organization [GO:0007032]; energy homeostasis [GO:0097009]; immune system process [GO:0002376]; intracellular signal transduction [GO:0035556]; macroautophagy [GO:0016236]; mitophagy [GO:0000423]; negative regulation of protein ubiquitination [GO:0031397]; negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0000122]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of long-term synaptic potentiation [GO:1900273]; positive regulation of protein localization to plasma membrane [GO:1903078]; positive regulation of protein phosphorylation [GO:0001934]; positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0045944]; protein import into nucleus [GO:0006606]; protein localization [GO:0008104]; protein localization to perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:1905719]; protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]; regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling [GO:0043122]; regulation of mitochondrion organization [GO:0010821]; regulation of protein complex stability [GO:0061635]; regulation of Ras protein signal transduction [GO:0046578]; response to ischemia [GO:0002931]; response to mitochondrial depolarisation [GO:0098780]; selective autophagy [GO:0061912]; temperature homeostasis [GO:0001659]; transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0006366]; ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0006511]","P05067; P54253; O95817; Q16543; P34972; Q15038; O14576-2; Q2V2M9; Q2V2M9-4; O95166; Q9H0R8; P60520; P0DMV8; P42858; Q9Y6K9; Q14145; Q5S007; Q9UDY8; Q9H492; Q9GZQ8; Q9BXW4; Q13163; Q14596; P04629; Q96CV9; P50542-3; Q9UGJ0; P41743; Q12923; P54725; P58004; Q96B97; P84022; P37840; Q13501; Q9UNE7; Q9Y4K3; P07437; P0CG48; P11473; Q9UBQ0-2; Q8IZQ1; P19544-6; A0A024RC47; A8K2U6; P38182; Q9Z2X8; P28700; O70405; P12504","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20168092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22792322}.

Cannot remove 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). According to an alternative model, involved in DNA demethylation by mediating DNA glycolase activity toward 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) produced by deamination of 5hmC. Also involved in DNA repair by acting as a thymine-DNA glycosylase that mediates correction of G/T mispairs to G/C pairs: in the DNA of higher eukaryotes, hydrolytic deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine leads to the formation of G/T mismatches. Its role in the repair of canonical base damage is however minor compared to its role in DNA demethylation. It is capable of hydrolyzing the carbon-nitrogen bond between the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA and a mispaired thymine. In addition to the G/T, it can remove thymine also from C/T and T/T mispairs in the order G/T >> C/T > T/T. It has no detectable activity on apyrimidinic sites and does not catalyze the removal of thymine from A/T pairs or from single-stranded DNA. It can also remove uracil and 5-bromouracil from mispairs with guanine. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21862836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22327402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22573813, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22962365, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8127859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8407958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8662714}.","TDG","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; PML body [GO:0016605]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; chloride ion binding [GO:0031404]; damaged DNA binding [GO:0003684]; DNA binding [GO:0003677]; DNA N-glycosylase activity [GO:0019104]; DNA-binding transcription factor binding [GO:0140297]; double-stranded DNA binding [GO:0003690]; G/U mismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylase activity [GO:0043739]; magnesium ion binding [GO:0000287]; mismatched DNA binding [GO:0030983]; nucleic acid binding [GO:0003676]; protein domain specific binding [GO:0019904]; protein homodimerization activity [GO:0042803]; protein kinase C binding [GO:0005080]; protein self-association [GO:0043621]; pyrimidine-specific mismatch base pair DNA N-glycosylase activity [GO:0008263]; sodium ion binding [GO:0031402]; SUMO binding [GO:0032183]; transcription coregulator activity [GO:0003712]; uracil DNA N-glycosylase activity [GO:0004844]; base-excision repair [GO:0006284]; base-excision repair, AP site formation [GO:0006285]; depyrimidination [GO:0045008]; DNA demethylation [GO:0080111]; mismatch repair [GO:0006298]; negative regulation of chromatin binding [GO:0035562]; negative regulation of protein binding [GO:0032091]; negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0000122]; oxidative DNA demethylation [GO:0035511]; regulation of DNA N-glycosylase activity [GO:1902544]; regulation of embryonic development [GO:0045995]; regulation of gene expression, epigenetic [GO:0040029]","Q9GZX7; Q92870-2; P24522; P28799; P04792; O60333-2; Q15788; Q15788-2; P07196; D3DTS7; P60891; Q9Y3C5; P37840; P63165; P61956; P02766; O76024; O88846","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:8662714}.","ENST00000392872.8;",0.0093206777733094

At the same time, LAP chain interacts with 'milieu molecules', such as LTBP1 and LRRC32/GARP, that control activation of TGF-beta-2 and maintain it in a latent state during storage in extracellular milieus (By similarity). Once activated following release of LAP, TGF-beta-2 acts by binding to TGF-beta receptors (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2), which transduce signal (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P01137, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P04202, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22772368, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22772371}.","TGFB2","axon [GO:0030424];

Involved in many biological processes, such as bone development, angiogenesis, wound healing, cellular differentiation, chromatin modification and apoptosis (PubMed:1683874, PubMed:7935379, PubMed:9252372, PubMed:27270573). Acts as a protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase by mediating the cross-linking of proteins, such as ACO2, HSPB6, FN1, HMGB1, RAP1GDS1, SLC25A4/ANT1, SPP1 and WDR54 (PubMed:23941696, PubMed:24349085, PubMed:29618516, PubMed:30458214). Under physiological conditions, the protein cross-linking activity is inhibited by GTP; inhibition is relieved by Ca(2+) in response to various stresses (PubMed:7649299, PubMed:7592956, PubMed:18092889). When secreted, catalyzes cross-linking of proteins of the extracellular matrix, such as FN1 and SPP1 resulting in the formation of scaffolds (PubMed:12506096). Plays a key role during apoptosis, both by (1) promoting the cross-linking of cytoskeletal proteins resulting in condensation of the cytoplasm, and by (2) mediating cross-linking proteins of the extracellular matrix, resulting in the irreversible formation of scaffolds that stabilize the integrity of the dying cells before their clearance by phagocytosis, thereby preventing the leakage of harmful intracellular components (PubMed:7935379, PubMed:9252372). In addition to protein cross-linking, can use different monoamine substrates to catalyze a vast array of protein post-translational modifications: mediates aminylation of serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline or histamine into glutamine residues of target proteins to generate protein serotonylation, dopaminylation, noradrenalinylation or histaminylation, respectively (PubMed:23797785, PubMed:30867594). Mediates protein serotonylation of small GTPases during activation and aggregation of platelets, leading to constitutive activation of these GTPases (By similarity). Plays a key role in chromatin organization by mediating serotonylation and dopaminylation of histone H3 (PubMed:30867594, PubMed:32273471). Catalyzes serotonylation of 'Gln-5' of histone H3 (H3Q5ser) during serotonergic neuron differentiation, thereby facilitating transcription (PubMed:30867594). Acts as a mediator of neurotransmission-independent role of nuclear dopamine in ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons: catalyzes dopaminylation of 'Gln-5' of histone H3 (H3Q5dop), thereby regulating relapse-related transcriptional plasticity in the reward system (PubMed:32273471). Regulates vein remodeling by mediating serotonylation and subsequent inactivation of ATP2A2/SERCA2 (By similarity). Also acts as a protein deamidase by mediating the side chain deamidation of specific glutamine residues of proteins to glutamate (PubMed:9623982, PubMed:20547769). Catalyzes specific deamidation of protein gliadin, a component of wheat gluten in the diet (PubMed:9623982). May also act as an isopeptidase cleaving the previously formed cross-links (PubMed:26250429, PubMed:27131890). Also able to participate in signaling pathways independently of its acyltransferase activity: acts as a signal transducer in alpha-1 adrenergic receptor-mediated stimulation of phospholipase C-delta (PLCD) activity and is required for coupling alpha-1 adrenergic agonists to the stimulation of phosphoinositide lipid metabolism (PubMed:8943303). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08587, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P21981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12506096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1683874, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18092889, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20547769, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23797785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23941696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24349085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26250429, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27131890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29618516, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30458214, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30867594, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31991788, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32273471, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7592956, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7649299, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7935379, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8943303, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9252372, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9623982, ECO:0000303|PubMed:27270573}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 2]: Has cytotoxic activity: is able to induce apoptosis independently of its acyltransferase activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17116873}.","TGM2","chromatin [GO:0000785]; collagen-containing extracellular matrix [GO:0062023]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; extracellular matrix [GO:0031012]; focal adhesion [GO:0005925]; intrinsic component of plasma membrane [GO:0031226]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:0048471]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; calcium ion binding [GO:0005509]; GTP binding [GO:0005525]; histone dopaminyltransferase activity [GO:0120297]; histone serotonyltransferase activity [GO:0120295]; peptidase activity [GO:0008233]; peptide histaminyltransferase activity [GO:0120299]; peptide noradrenalinyltransferase activity [GO:0120298]; protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase activity [GO:0003810]; protein-glutamine glutaminase activity [GO:0050568]; apoptotic cell clearance [GO:0043277]; bone development [GO:0060348]; branching involved in salivary gland morphogenesis [GO:0060445]; cellular response to cocaine [GO:0071314]; cellular response to dopamine [GO:1903351]; cellular response to serotonin [GO:1904015]; negative regulation of endoplasmic reticulum calcium ion concentration [GO:0032471]; peptide cross-linking [GO:0018149]; phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway [GO:0007200]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of cell adhesion [GO:0045785]; positive regulation of GTPase activity [GO:0043547]; positive regulation of mitochondrial calcium ion concentration [GO:0051561]; positive regulation of neurogenesis [GO:0050769]; positive regulation of small GTPase mediated signal transduction [GO:0051057]; protein deamination [GO:0018277]; protein homooligomerization [GO:0051260]; proteolysis [GO:0006508]; regulation of apoptotic cell clearance [GO:2000425]; regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0042981]; salivary gland cavitation [GO:0060662]","Q12802; PRO_0000000092 [P05067]; PRO_0000005794 [P39060]; P02751; P08727; PRO_0000018520 [P28300]; Q04206; P40337; G5E9A7; O00429-3; P50570-2; P29692-2; Q06787-7; P04792; P42858; O60333-2; D3DTS7; P60891; Q5T160; Q8N488; Q14141; O95416; Q7Z699; O14656-2; Q86WV8; P02766; Q9NYH9; O76024","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24349085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29618516, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9575137}.

TREX is recruited to spliced mRNAs by a transcription-independent mechanism, binds to mRNA upstream of the exon-junction complex (EJC) and is recruited in a splicing- and cap-dependent manner to a region near the 5' end of the mRNA where it functions in mRNA export to the cytoplasm via the TAP/NFX1 pathway.

Binds to U-rich sequences immediately downstream from a 5' splice sites in a uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U snRNP)-dependent fashion, thereby modulating alternative pre-RNA splicing (PubMed:11106748, PubMed:8576255). Preferably binds to the U-rich IAS1 sequence in a U1 snRNP-dependent manner; this binding is optimal if a 5' splice site is adjacent to IAS1 (By similarity). Activates the use of heterologous 5' splice sites; the activation depends on the intron sequence downstream from the 5' splice site, with a preference for a downstream U-rich sequence (PubMed:11106748). By interacting with SNRPC/U1-C, promotes recruitment and binding of spliceosomal U1 snRNP to 5' splice sites followed by U-rich sequences, thereby facilitating atypical 5' splice site recognition by U1 snRNP (PubMed:11106748, PubMed:12486009, PubMed:17488725). Activates splicing of alternative exons with weak 5' splice sites followed by a U-rich stretch on its own pre-mRNA and on TIAR mRNA (By similarity). Acts as a modulator of alternative splicing for the apoptotic FAS receptor, thereby promoting apoptosis (PubMed:11106748, PubMed:1934064, PubMed:17488725). Binds to the 5' splice site region of FAS intron 5 to promote accumulation of transcripts that include exon 6 at the expense of transcripts in which exon 6 is skipped, thereby leading to the transcription of a membrane-bound apoptotic FAS receptor, which promotes apoptosis (PubMed:11106748, PubMed:1934064, PubMed:17488725). Binds to a conserved AU-rich cis element in COL2A1 intron 2 and modulates alternative splicing of COL2A1 exon 2 (PubMed:17580305). Also binds to the equivalent AT-rich element in COL2A1 genomic DNA, and may thereby be involved in the regulation of transcription (PubMed:17580305). Binds specifically to a polypyrimidine-rich controlling element (PCE) located between the weak 5' splice site and the intronic splicing silencer of CFTR mRNA to promote exon 9 inclusion, thereby antagonizing PTB1 and its role in exon skipping of CFTR exon 9 (PubMed:14966131). Involved in the repression of mRNA translation by binding to AU-rich elements (AREs) located in mRNA 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), including target ARE-bearing mRNAs encoding TNF and PTGS2 (By similarity). Also participates in the cellular response to environmental stress, by acting downstream of the stress-induced phosphorylation of EIF2S1/EIF2A to promote the recruitment of untranslated mRNAs to cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs), leading to stress-induced translational arrest (PubMed:10613902). Formation and recruitment to SGs is regulated by Zn(2+) (By similarity).

Involved in immune and inflammatory responses signaled by cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, or pathogens via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) through terminating NF-kappa-B activity. Essential component of a ubiquitin-editing protein complex, comprising also RNF11, ITCH and TAX1BP1, that ensures the transient nature of inflammatory signaling pathways. In cooperation with TAX1BP1 promotes disassembly of E2-E3 ubiquitin protein ligase complexes in IL-1R and TNFR-1 pathways; affected are at least E3 ligases TRAF6, TRAF2 and BIRC2, and E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBE2N and UBE2D3. In cooperation with TAX1BP1 promotes ubiquitination of UBE2N and proteasomal degradation of UBE2N and UBE2D3. Upon TNF stimulation, deubiquitinates 'Lys-63'-polyubiquitin chains on RIPK1 and catalyzes the formation of 'Lys-48'-polyubiquitin chains. This leads to RIPK1 proteasomal degradation and consequently termination of the TNF- or LPS-mediated activation of NF-kappa-B. Deubiquitinates TRAF6 probably acting on 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin. Upon T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated T-cell activation, deubiquitinates 'Lys-63'-polyubiquitin chains on MALT1 thereby mediating disassociation of the CBM (CARD11:BCL10:MALT1) and IKK complexes and preventing sustained IKK activation. Deubiquitinates NEMO/IKBKG; the function is facilitated by TNIP1 and leads to inhibition of NF-kappa-B activation. Upon stimulation by bacterial peptidoglycans, probably deubiquitinates RIPK2. Can also inhibit I-kappa-B-kinase (IKK) through a non-catalytic mechanism which involves polyubiquitin; polyubiquitin promotes association with IKBKG and prevents IKK MAP3K7-mediated phosphorylation. Targets TRAF2 for lysosomal degradation. In vitro able to deubiquitinate 'Lys-11'-, 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63' polyubiquitin chains. Inhibitor of programmed cell death. Has a role in the function of the lymphoid system. Required for LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFN beta in LPS-tolerized macrophages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14748687, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15258597, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16684768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17961127, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18164316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18952128, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19494296, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22099304, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23827681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8692885, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9299557, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9882303}.","TNFAIP3","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; lysosome [GO:0005764]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; cysteine-type deubiquitinase activity [GO:0004843]; DNA binding [GO:0003677]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; K63-linked polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding [GO:0070530]; kinase binding [GO:0019900]; Lys63-specific deubiquitinase activity [GO:0061578]; protease binding [GO:0002020]; protein C-terminus binding [GO:0008022]; protein self-association [GO:0043621]; ubiquitin binding [GO:0043130]; ubiquitin-protein transferase activity [GO:0004842]; zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]; apoptotic process [GO:0006915]; B-1 B cell homeostasis [GO:0001922]; cell migration [GO:0016477]; cellular response to hydrogen peroxide [GO:0070301]; cellular response to lipopolysaccharide [GO:0071222]; cytoskeleton organization [GO:0007010]; establishment of protein localization to vacuole [GO:0072666]; inflammatory response [GO:0006954]; negative regulation of B cell activation [GO:0050869]; negative regulation of bone resorption [GO:0045779]; negative regulation of CD40 signaling pathway [GO:2000349]; negative regulation of chronic inflammatory response [GO:0002677]; negative regulation of cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0045736]; negative regulation of endothelial cell apoptotic process [GO:2000352]; negative regulation of extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway via death domain receptors [GO:1902042]; negative regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling [GO:0043124]; negative regulation of inflammatory response [GO:0050728]; negative regulation of innate immune response [GO:0045824]; negative regulation of interleukin-1 beta production [GO:0032691]; negative regulation of interleukin-2 production [GO:0032703]; negative regulation of interleukin-6 production [GO:0032715]; negative regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity [GO:0032088]; negative regulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 1 signaling pathway [GO:0070429]; negative regulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 signaling pathway [GO:0070433]; negative regulation of osteoclast proliferation [GO:0090291]; negative regulation of protein ubiquitination [GO:0031397]; negative regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation [GO:0048662]; negative regulation of toll-like receptor 2 signaling pathway [GO:0034136]; negative regulation of toll-like receptor 3 signaling pathway [GO:0034140]; negative regulation of toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway [GO:0034144]; negative regulation of toll-like receptor 5 signaling pathway [GO:0034148]; negative regulation of tumor necrosis factor production [GO:0032720]; nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing signaling pathway [GO:0070423]; positive regulation of hepatocyte proliferation [GO:2000347]; positive regulation of protein catabolic process [GO:0045732]; positive regulation of Wnt signaling pathway [GO:0030177]; protein deubiquitination [GO:0016579]; protein deubiquitination involved in ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0071947]; protein K11-linked deubiquitination [GO:0035871]; protein K29-linked deubiquitination [GO:0035523]; protein K33-linked deubiquitination [GO:1990168]; protein K48-linked deubiquitination [GO:0071108]; protein K48-linked ubiquitination [GO:0070936]; protein K63-linked deubiquitination [GO:0070536]; regulation of defense response to virus by host [GO:0050691]; regulation of germinal center formation [GO:0002634]; regulation of tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0010803]; regulation of vascular wound healing [GO:0061043]; response to molecule of bacterial origin [GO:0002237]; response to muramyl dipeptide [GO:0032495]; tolerance induction to lipopolysaccharide [GO:0072573]","Q96B67; Q14790; O95995; Q9Y6K9; Q8TBB1; Q4G0R1; P54725; Q9Y3C5; Q9NWF9; Q86VP1; P21580; Q15025; Q8NFZ5; Q96KP6; Q12933; P36406; P68510","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.

Blocks viral replication early in the life cycle, after viral entry but before reverse transcription. In addition to acting as a capsid-specific restriction factor, also acts as a pattern recognition receptor that activates innate immune signaling in response to the retroviral capsid lattice. Binding to the viral capsid triggers its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and in concert with the heterodimeric ubiquitin conjugating enzyme complex UBE2V1-UBE2N (also known as UBC13-UEV1A complex) generates 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains, which in turn are catalysts in the autophosphorylation of the MAP3K7/TAK1 complex (includes TAK1, TAB2, and TAB3). Activation of the MAP3K7/TAK1 complex by autophosphorylation results in the induction and expression of NF-kappa-B and MAPK-responsive inflammatory genes, thereby leading to an innate immune response in the infected cell. Restricts infection by N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV), equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) (PubMed:17156811). Plays a role in regulating autophagy through activation of autophagy regulator BECN1 by causing its dissociation from its inhibitors BCL2 and TAB2 (PubMed:25127057).

ZNF207/BuGZ is mainly composed of disordered low-complexity regions and undergoes phase transition or coacervation to form temperature-dependent liquid droplets. Coacervation promotes microtubule bundling and concentrates tubulin, promoting microtubule polymerization and assembly of spindle and spindle matrix by concentrating its building blocks (PubMed:26388440). Also acts as a regulator of mitotic chromosome alignment by mediating the stability and kinetochore loading of BUB3 (PubMed:24462186, PubMed:24462187). Mechanisms by which BUB3 is protected are unclear: according to a first report, ZNF207/BuGZ may act by blocking ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of BUB3 (PubMed:24462186).
