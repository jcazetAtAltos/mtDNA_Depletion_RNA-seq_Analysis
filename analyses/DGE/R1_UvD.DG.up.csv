F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F(1) - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core and F(0) - containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation.

The respiratory chain contains 3 multisubunit complexes succinate dehydrogenase (complex II, CII), ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome b-c1 complex, complex III, CIII) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV, CIV), that cooperate to transfer electrons derived from NADH and succinate to molecular oxygen, creating an electrochemical gradient over the inner membrane that drives transmembrane transport and the ATP synthase. Cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water. Electrons originating from reduced cytochrome c in the intermembrane space (IMS) are transferred via the dinuclear copper A center (CU(A)) of subunit 2 and heme A of subunit 1 to the active site in subunit 1, a binuclear center (BNC) formed by heme A3 and copper B (CU(B)). The BNC reduces molecular oxygen to 2 water molecules using 4 electrons from cytochrome c in the IMS and 4 protons from the mitochondrial matrix. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P00420}.","MT-CO3","integral component of membrane [GO:0016021]; mitochondrial inner membrane [GO:0005743]; mitochondrial membrane [GO:0031966]; mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV [GO:0005751]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; respiratory chain complex IV [GO:0045277]; cytochrome-c oxidase activity [GO:0004129]; electron transfer activity [GO:0009055]; oxidoreduction-driven active transmembrane transporter activity [GO:0015453]; aerobic respiration [GO:0009060]; cellular respiration [GO:0045333]; mitochondrial electron transport, cytochrome c to oxygen [GO:0006123]; respiratory chain complex IV assembly [GO:0008535]","P37840","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion inner membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:30030519}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:30030519}.","ENST00000362079.2;",0.000564555090338785
