Mainly acts as a transcription repressor that binds DNA independently of DP proteins and specifically recognizes the E2 recognition site 5'-TTTC[CG]CGC-3'. Directly represses transcription of classical E2F transcription factors such as E2F1. Acts as a regulator of S-phase by recognizing and binding the E2-related site 5'-TTCCCGCC-3' and mediating repression of G1/S-regulated genes. Plays a key role in polyploidization of cells in placenta and liver by regulating the endocycle, probably by repressing genes promoting cytokinesis and antagonizing action of classical E2F proteins (E2F1, E2F2 and/or E2F3). Required for placental development by promoting polyploidization of trophoblast giant cells. Also involved in DNA damage response: up-regulated by p53/TP53 following genotoxic stress and acts as a downstream effector of p53/TP53-dependent repression by mediating repression of indirect p53/TP53 target genes involved in DNA replication. Acts as a promoter of sprouting angiogenesis, possibly by acting as a transcription activator: associates with HIF1A, recognizes and binds the VEGFA promoter, which is different from canonical E2 recognition site, and activates expression of the VEGFA gene. Acts as a negative regulator of keratinocyte differentiation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14633988, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15133492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18202719, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19223542, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21248772, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22802528, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22802529, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22903062}.","E2F7","chromatin [GO:0000785]; nuclear speck [GO:0016607]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; RNA polymerase II transcription regulator complex [GO:0090575]; cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0000987]; DNA-binding transcription factor activity [GO:0003700]; DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific [GO:0000981]; DNA-binding transcription repressor activity [GO:0001217]; DNA-binding transcription repressor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific [GO:0001227]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0000978]; sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding [GO:1990837]; chorionic trophoblast cell differentiation [GO:0060718]; DNA damage response, signal transduction by p53 class mediator [GO:0030330]; hepatocyte differentiation [GO:0070365]; negative regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0008285]; negative regulation of cytokinesis [GO:0032466]; negative regulation of G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle [GO:2000134]; negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0000122]; negative regulation of transcription involved in G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0071930]; placenta development [GO:0001890]; positive regulation of DNA endoreduplication [GO:0032877]; positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0045944]; regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0006357]; sprouting angiogenesis [GO:0002040]; trophoblast giant cell differentiation [GO:0060707]","Q96AV8; A0AVK6","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15133492}.","ENST00000322886.12 [Q96AV8-1];ENST00000416496.6 [Q96AV8-2];",0.000483091393867514

Stimulates cAMP production, calcium mobilization and tyrosine kinase Src inducing the release of heparin-bound epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) and subsequent transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), activating downstream signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt and ERK/MAPK. Mediates pleiotropic functions among others in the cardiovascular, endocrine, reproductive, immune and central nervous systems. Has a role in cardioprotection by reducing cardiac hypertrophy and perivascular fibrosis in a RAMP3-dependent manner. Regulates arterial blood pressure by stimulating vasodilation and reducing vascular smooth muscle and microvascular endothelial cell proliferation. Plays a role in blood glucose homeostasis contributing to the insulin secretion response by pancreatic beta cells. Triggers mitochondrial apoptosis during pachytene spermatocyte differentiation. Stimulates uterine epithelial cell proliferation. Enhances uterine contractility in response to oxytocin. Contributes to thymic atrophy by inducing apoptosis. Attenuates TNF-mediated endothelial expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules. Promotes neuritogenesis in developing hippocampal neurons. Plays a role in acute neuroprotection against NMDA-induced excitotoxic neuronal death. Increases firing activity and intracellular calcium oscillations in luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) neurons. Inhibits early osteoblast proliferation at growth plate during skeletal development. Inhibits mature adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation. Involved in the recruitment of beta-arrestin 2 ARRB2 at the plasma membrane in epithelial cells. Functions also as a receptor for aldosterone mediating rapid regulation of vascular contractibility through the PI3K/ERK signaling pathway. Involved in cancer progression regulation. Stimulates cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) proliferation by a rapid genomic response through the EGFR/ERK transduction pathway. Associated with EGFR, may act as a transcription factor activating growth regulatory genes (c-fos, cyclin D1).

Acts as a negative regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis by mediating the retention of the SCAP-SREBP complex in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby blocking the processing of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) SREBF1/SREBP1 and SREBF2/SREBP2 (PubMed:12202038, PubMed:16399501, PubMed:32322062). Binds oxysterol, including 25-hydroxycholesterol, regulating interaction with SCAP and retention of the SCAP-SREBP complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:32322062). In presence of oxysterol, interacts with SCAP, retaining the SCAP-SREBP complex in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby preventing SCAP from escorting SREBF1/SREBP1 and SREBF2/SREBP2 to the Golgi (PubMed:15899885, PubMed:32322062). Sterol deprivation or phosphorylation by PCK1 reduce oxysterol-binding, disrupting the interaction between INSIG1 and SCAP, thereby promoting Golgi transport of the SCAP-SREBP complex, followed by processing and nuclear translocation of SREBF1/SREBP1 and SREBF2/SREBP2 (PubMed:32322062). Also regulates cholesterol synthesis by regulating degradation of HMGCR: initiates the sterol-mediated ubiquitin-mediated endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of HMGCR via recruitment of the reductase to the ubiquitin ligases AMFR/gp78 and/or RNF139 (PubMed:12535518, PubMed:16168377, PubMed:22143767).

With MAP3K3/MKK3, catalyzes the concomitant phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in the MAP kinases p38 MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and MAPK14 and plays an important role in the regulation of cellular responses to cytokines and all kinds of stresses. Especially, MAP2K3/MKK3 and MAP2K6/MKK6 are both essential for the activation of MAPK11 and MAPK13 induced by environmental stress, whereas MAP2K6/MKK6 is the major MAPK11 activator in response to TNF. MAP2K6/MKK6 also phosphorylates and activates PAK6. The p38 MAP kinase signal transduction pathway leads to direct activation of transcription factors. Nuclear targets of p38 MAP kinase include the transcription factors ATF2 and ELK1. Within the p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway, MAP3K6/MKK6 mediates phosphorylation of STAT4 through MAPK14 activation, and is therefore required for STAT4 activation and STAT4-regulated gene expression in response to IL-12 stimulation. The pathway is also crucial for IL-6-induced SOCS3 expression and down-regulation of IL-6-mediated gene induction; and for IFNG-dependent gene transcription. Has a role in osteoclast differentiation through NF-kappa-B transactivation by TNFSF11, and in endochondral ossification and since SOX9 is another likely downstream target of the p38 MAPK pathway. MAP2K6/MKK6 mediates apoptotic cell death in thymocytes. Acts also as a regulator for melanocytes dendricity, through the modulation of Rho family GTPases. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10961885, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11727828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15550393, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20869211, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8622669, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8626699, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8663074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9218798}.","MAP2K6","cytoskeleton [GO:0005856]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; MAP kinase kinase activity [GO:0004708]; phosphatase activator activity [GO:0019211]; protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity [GO:0043539]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004713]; apoptotic process [GO:0006915]; bone development [GO:0060348]; cardiac muscle contraction [GO:0060048]; cellular response to sorbitol [GO:0072709]; cellular senescence [GO:0090398]; DNA damage induced protein phosphorylation [GO:0006975]; MAPK cascade [GO:0000165]; negative regulation of cold-induced thermogenesis [GO:0120163]; nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing signaling pathway [GO:0070423]; osteoblast differentiation [GO:0001649]; ovulation cycle process [GO:0022602]; p38MAPK cascade [GO:0038066]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of MAP kinase activity [GO:0043406]; positive regulation of nitric-oxide synthase biosynthetic process [GO:0051770]; positive regulation of prostaglandin secretion [GO:0032308]; regulation of cell cycle [GO:0051726]; regulation of signal transduction by p53 class mediator [GO:1901796]; response to ischemia [GO:0002931]; response to xenobiotic stimulus [GO:0009410]; signal transduction [GO:0007165]; stress-activated MAPK cascade [GO:0051403]","Q5S007; Q16539; Q16236; Q9NRD5; O76024; P52564-1","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9768359}.

Involved in cell proliferation and cell growth arrest by positive and negative regulation of the cell cycle. Can promote cell growth by phosphorylating and activating RAF1, which mediates the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade, and/or by up-regulating CDKN1A, which facilitates active cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex formation in glioma cells. In intestinal cells stimulated by the phorbol ester PMA, can trigger a cell cycle arrest program which is associated with the accumulation of the hyper-phosphorylated growth-suppressive form of RB1 and induction of the CDK inhibitors CDKN1A and CDKN1B. Exhibits anti-apoptotic function in glioma cells and protects them from apoptosis by suppressing the p53/TP53-mediated activation of IGFBP3, and in leukemia cells mediates anti-apoptotic action by phosphorylating BCL2. During macrophage differentiation induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1), is translocated to the nucleus and is associated with macrophage development. After wounding, translocates from focal contacts to lamellipodia and participates in the modulation of desmosomal adhesion. Plays a role in cell motility by phosphorylating CSPG4, which induces association of CSPG4 with extensive lamellipodia at the cell periphery and polarization of the cell accompanied by increases in cell motility. During chemokine-induced CD4(+) T cell migration, phosphorylates CDC42-guanine exchange factor DOCK8 resulting in its dissociation from LRCH1 and the activation of GTPase CDC42 (PubMed:28028151). Is highly expressed in a number of cancer cells where it can act as a tumor promoter and is implicated in malignant phenotypes of several tumors such as gliomas and breast cancers. Negatively regulates myocardial contractility and positively regulates angiogenesis, platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in arteries. Mediates hypertrophic growth of neonatal cardiomyocytes, in part through a MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2)-dependent signaling pathway, and upon PMA treatment, is required to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy up to heart failure and death, by increasing protein synthesis, protein-DNA ratio and cell surface area. Regulates cardiomyocyte function by phosphorylating cardiac troponin T (TNNT2/CTNT), which induces significant reduction in actomyosin ATPase activity, myofilament calcium sensitivity and myocardial contractility. In angiogenesis, is required for full endothelial cell migration, adhesion to vitronectin (VTN), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)-dependent regulation of kinase activation and vascular tube formation. Involved in the stabilization of VEGFA mRNA at post-transcriptional level and mediates VEGFA-induced cell proliferation. In the regulation of calcium-induced platelet aggregation, mediates signals from the CD36/GP4 receptor for granule release, and activates the integrin heterodimer ITGA2B-ITGB3 through the RAP1GAP pathway for adhesion. During response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), may regulate selective LPS-induced macrophage functions involved in host defense and inflammation. But in some inflammatory responses, may negatively regulate NF-kappa-B-induced genes, through IL1A-dependent induction of NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA/IKBA). Upon stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), phosphorylates EIF4G1, which modulates EIF4G1 binding to MKNK1 and may be involved in the regulation of EIF4E phosphorylation. Phosphorylates KIT, leading to inhibition of KIT activity. Phosphorylates ATF2 which promotes cooperation between ATF2 and JUN, activating transcription. Phosphorylates SOCS2 at 'Ser-52' facilitating its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P20444, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10848585, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11909826, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12724315, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12832403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15016832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15504744, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15526160, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18056764, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19176525, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21576361, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23990668, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28028151, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9738012, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9830023, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9873035, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9927633}.","PRKCA","alphav-beta3 integrin-PKCalpha complex [GO:0035866]; cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; mitochondrial membrane [GO:0031966]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:0048471]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; calcium-dependent protein kinase C activity [GO:0004698]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; histone kinase activity (H3-T6 specific) [GO:0035403]; integrin binding [GO:0005178]; protein kinase activity [GO:0004672]; protein kinase C activity [GO:0004697]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]; angiogenesis [GO:0001525]; apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:0097190]; cell adhesion [GO:0007155]; desmosome assembly [GO:0002159]; intracellular signal transduction [GO:0035556]; mitotic nuclear membrane disassembly [GO:0007077]; negative regulation of glial cell apoptotic process [GO:0034351]; peptidyl-serine phosphorylation [GO:0018105]; peptidyl-threonine phosphorylation [GO:0018107]; positive regulation of adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway [GO:0106071]; positive regulation of angiogenesis [GO:0045766]; positive regulation of blood vessel endothelial cell migration [GO:0043536]; positive regulation of bone resorption [GO:0045780]; positive regulation of cardiac muscle hypertrophy [GO:0010613]; positive regulation of cell adhesion [GO:0045785]; positive regulation of cell migration [GO:0030335]; positive regulation of dense core granule biogenesis [GO:2000707]; positive regulation of endothelial cell migration [GO:0010595]; positive regulation of endothelial cell proliferation [GO:0001938]; positive regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade [GO:0070374]; positive regulation of lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0031666]; positive regulation of macrophage differentiation [GO:0045651]; positive regulation of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0045931]; post-translational protein modification [GO:0043687]; protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]; regulation of mRNA stability [GO:0043488]; regulation of platelet aggregation [GO:0090330]; response to interleukin-1 [GO:0070555]","Q15027; Q06481-5; Q66PJ3-4; Q13072; Q8N9N5-2; Q96A33; Q96LY2-2; P15169; P43234; O95424; O43598; P21728; P00533; P60228; Q96J88-3; Q8IVH2-2; Q96NE9-2; O14926; Q06547-3; P19440-3; Q9UJ42; P62805; Q9UBN7; P52597; Q92826; Q02363; Q96FT9-2; P17936; P26951; Q9BYR8; Q9Y234; P51884; Q9H213; P80192; Q15759; A0JLT2-2; Q9H8H3; Q8N983-3; P49821; Q2M1J6; Q9BRX2; Q9Y6X2; P11309-2; Q6P1J6-2; Q9UNA4; Q02156; P07225; Q3YEC7-3; O94844; Q9NWS8-3; Q9ULK6-3; P18077; P31431; Q99643; Q14141; Q01105-2; P37840; Q9Y5X0; P56693; Q9BRW5; O43761; P15884; Q3YBM2; P0CG48; P13051-2; Q8NB14; O95498; Q9NZC7-5; Q9BQ24; Q05CR2; Q8N0Y2-2; O15535; Q24008","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23990668}.

Through PTPRZ1 binding controls oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation by enhancing the phosphorylation of AFAP1L2 in order to activate the PI3K-AKT pathway (PubMed:27445335, PubMed:30667096). Forms a complex with PTPRZ1 and integrin alpha-V/beta-3 (ITGAV:ITGB3) that stimulates endothelial cell migration through SRC dephosphorylation and activation that consequently leads to ITGB3 'Tyr-773' phosphorylation (PubMed:19141530). In adult hippocampus promotes dendritic arborization, spine development, and functional integration and connectivity of newborn granule neurons through ALK by activating AKT signaling pathway (By similarity). Binds GPC2 and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) at the neuron surface, leading to abrogation of binding between PTPRS and CSPGs and neurite outgrowth promotion (By similarity).

Plays an important role in cellular stress response. Contributes to regulation of renal Na(+) retention, renal K(+) elimination, salt appetite, gastric acid secretion, intestinal Na(+)/H(+) exchange and nutrient transport, insulin-dependent salt sensitivity of blood pressure, salt sensitivity of peripheral glucose uptake, cardiac repolarization and memory consolidation. Up-regulates Na(+) channels: SCNN1A/ENAC, SCN5A and ASIC1/ACCN2, K(+) channels: KCNJ1/ROMK1, KCNA1-5, KCNQ1-5 and KCNE1, epithelial Ca(2+) channels: TRPV5 and TRPV6, chloride channels: BSND, CLCN2 and CFTR, glutamate transporters: SLC1A3/EAAT1, SLC1A2 /EAAT2, SLC1A1/EAAT3, SLC1A6/EAAT4 and SLC1A7/EAAT5, amino acid transporters: SLC1A5/ASCT2, SLC38A1/SN1 and SLC6A19, creatine transporter: SLC6A8, Na(+)/dicarboxylate cotransporter: SLC13A2/NADC1, Na(+)-dependent phosphate cotransporter: SLC34A2/NAPI-2B, glutamate receptor: GRIK2/GLUR6. Up-regulates carriers: SLC9A3/NHE3, SLC12A1/NKCC2, SLC12A3/NCC, SLC5A3/SMIT, SLC2A1/GLUT1, SLC5A1/SGLT1 and SLC15A2/PEPT2. Regulates enzymes: GSK3A/B, PMM2 and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase, and transcription factors: CTNNB1 and nuclear factor NF-kappa-B. Stimulates sodium transport into epithelial cells by enhancing the stability and expression of SCNN1A/ENAC. This is achieved by phosphorylating the NEDD4L ubiquitin E3 ligase, promoting its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, thereby preventing it from binding to SCNN1A/ENAC and targeting it for degradation. Regulates store-operated Ca(+2) entry (SOCE) by stimulating ORAI1 and STIM1. Regulates KCNJ1/ROMK1 directly via its phosphorylation or indirectly via increased interaction with SLC9A3R2/NHERF2. Phosphorylates MDM2 and activates MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53/TP53. Phosphorylates MAPT/TAU and mediates microtubule depolymerization and neurite formation in hippocampal neurons. Phosphorylates SLC2A4/GLUT4 and up-regulates its activity. Phosphorylates APBB1/FE65 and promotes its localization to the nucleus. Phosphorylates MAPK1/ERK2 and activates it by enhancing its interaction with MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Phosphorylates FBXW7 and plays an inhibitory role in the NOTCH1 signaling. Phosphorylates FOXO1 resulting in its relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Phosphorylates FOXO3, promoting its exit from the nucleus and interference with FOXO3-dependent transcription. Phosphorylates BRAF and MAP3K3/MEKK3 and inhibits their activity. Phosphorylates SLC9A3/NHE3 in response to dexamethasone, resulting in its activation and increased localization at the cell membrane. Phosphorylates CREB1. Necessary for vascular remodeling during angiogenesis. Sustained high levels and activity may contribute to conditions such as hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Isoform 2 exhibited a greater effect on cell plasma membrane expression of SCNN1A/ENAC and Na(+) transport than isoform 1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154281, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11410590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11696533, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12397388, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12590200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12634932, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12650886, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12761204, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12911626, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14623317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14706641, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15040001, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15044175, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15234985, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15319523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15496163, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15733869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15737648, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15845389, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15888551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16036218, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16443776, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16982696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17382906, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18005662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18304449, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18753299, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19447520, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19756449, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20511718, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20730100, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21865597}.","SGK1","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endoplasmic reticulum membrane [GO:0005789]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nuclear speck [GO:0016607]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; calcium channel regulator activity [GO:0005246]; chloride channel regulator activity [GO:0017081]; potassium channel regulator activity [GO:0015459]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004712]; sodium channel regulator activity [GO:0017080]; apoptotic process [GO:0006915]; cellular response to aldosterone [GO:1904045]; cellular response to DNA damage stimulus [GO:0006974]; intracellular signal transduction [GO:0035556]; long-term memory [GO:0007616]; neuron projection morphogenesis [GO:0048812]; peptidyl-serine phosphorylation [GO:0018105]; positive regulation of transporter activity [GO:0032411]; protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]; regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0042981]; regulation of blood pressure [GO:0008217]; regulation of catalytic activity [GO:0050790]; regulation of cell growth [GO:0001558]; regulation of cell migration [GO:0030334]; regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0042127]; regulation of DNA-binding transcription factor activity [GO:0051090]; regulation of gastric acid secretion [GO:0060453]; regulation of signal transduction by p53 class mediator [GO:1901796]; renal sodium ion absorption [GO:0070294]; sodium ion transport [GO:0006814]","O15182; Q969L2; Q9ULP0-2; P49815; Q80UE6","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.

Low lipid levels are the main nutritional determinant for chondrogenic commitment of skeletal progenitor cells: when lipids levels are low, FOXO (FOXO1 and FOXO3) transcription factors promote expression of SOX9, which induces chondrogenic commitment and suppresses fatty acid oxidation (By similarity). Mechanistically, helps, but is not required, to remove epigenetic signatures of transcriptional repression and deposit active promoter and enhancer marks at chondrocyte-specific genes (By similarity). Acts in cooperation with the Hedgehog pathway-dependent GLI (GLI1 and GLI3) transcription factors (By similarity). In addition to cartilage development, also acts as a regulator of proliferation and differentiation in epithelial stem/progenitor cells: involved in the lung epithelium during branching morphogenesis, by balancing proliferation and differentiation and regulating the extracellular matrix (By similarity). Controls epithelial branching during kidney development (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q04887, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24038782, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8640233}.","SOX9","chromatin [GO:0000785]; nucleoplasm [GO:0005654];

Involved in many biological processes, such as bone development, angiogenesis, wound healing, cellular differentiation, chromatin modification and apoptosis (PubMed:1683874, PubMed:7935379, PubMed:9252372, PubMed:27270573). Acts as a protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase by mediating the cross-linking of proteins, such as ACO2, HSPB6, FN1, HMGB1, RAP1GDS1, SLC25A4/ANT1, SPP1 and WDR54 (PubMed:23941696, PubMed:24349085, PubMed:29618516, PubMed:30458214). Under physiological conditions, the protein cross-linking activity is inhibited by GTP; inhibition is relieved by Ca(2+) in response to various stresses (PubMed:7649299, PubMed:7592956, PubMed:18092889). When secreted, catalyzes cross-linking of proteins of the extracellular matrix, such as FN1 and SPP1 resulting in the formation of scaffolds (PubMed:12506096). Plays a key role during apoptosis, both by (1) promoting the cross-linking of cytoskeletal proteins resulting in condensation of the cytoplasm, and by (2) mediating cross-linking proteins of the extracellular matrix, resulting in the irreversible formation of scaffolds that stabilize the integrity of the dying cells before their clearance by phagocytosis, thereby preventing the leakage of harmful intracellular components (PubMed:7935379, PubMed:9252372). In addition to protein cross-linking, can use different monoamine substrates to catalyze a vast array of protein post-translational modifications: mediates aminylation of serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline or histamine into glutamine residues of target proteins to generate protein serotonylation, dopaminylation, noradrenalinylation or histaminylation, respectively (PubMed:23797785, PubMed:30867594). Mediates protein serotonylation of small GTPases during activation and aggregation of platelets, leading to constitutive activation of these GTPases (By similarity). Plays a key role in chromatin organization by mediating serotonylation and dopaminylation of histone H3 (PubMed:30867594, PubMed:32273471). Catalyzes serotonylation of 'Gln-5' of histone H3 (H3Q5ser) during serotonergic neuron differentiation, thereby facilitating transcription (PubMed:30867594). Acts as a mediator of neurotransmission-independent role of nuclear dopamine in ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons: catalyzes dopaminylation of 'Gln-5' of histone H3 (H3Q5dop), thereby regulating relapse-related transcriptional plasticity in the reward system (PubMed:32273471). Regulates vein remodeling by mediating serotonylation and subsequent inactivation of ATP2A2/SERCA2 (By similarity). Also acts as a protein deamidase by mediating the side chain deamidation of specific glutamine residues of proteins to glutamate (PubMed:9623982, PubMed:20547769). Catalyzes specific deamidation of protein gliadin, a component of wheat gluten in the diet (PubMed:9623982). May also act as an isopeptidase cleaving the previously formed cross-links (PubMed:26250429, PubMed:27131890). Also able to participate in signaling pathways independently of its acyltransferase activity: acts as a signal transducer in alpha-1 adrenergic receptor-mediated stimulation of phospholipase C-delta (PLCD) activity and is required for coupling alpha-1 adrenergic agonists to the stimulation of phosphoinositide lipid metabolism (PubMed:8943303). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08587, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P21981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12506096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1683874, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18092889, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20547769, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23797785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23941696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24349085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26250429, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27131890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29618516, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30458214, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30867594, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31991788, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32273471, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7592956, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7649299, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7935379, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8943303, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9252372, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9623982, ECO:0000303|PubMed:27270573}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 2]: Has cytotoxic activity: is able to induce apoptosis independently of its acyltransferase activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17116873}.","TGM2","chromatin [GO:0000785]; collagen-containing extracellular matrix [GO:0062023]; cytosol [GO:0005829]; endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]; extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]; extracellular matrix [GO:0031012]; focal adhesion [GO:0005925]; intrinsic component of plasma membrane [GO:0031226]; mitochondrion [GO:0005739]; nucleus [GO:0005634]; perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:0048471]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; calcium ion binding [GO:0005509]; GTP binding [GO:0005525]; histone dopaminyltransferase activity [GO:0120297]; histone serotonyltransferase activity [GO:0120295]; peptidase activity [GO:0008233]; peptide histaminyltransferase activity [GO:0120299]; peptide noradrenalinyltransferase activity [GO:0120298]; protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase activity [GO:0003810]; protein-glutamine glutaminase activity [GO:0050568]; apoptotic cell clearance [GO:0043277]; bone development [GO:0060348]; branching involved in salivary gland morphogenesis [GO:0060445]; cellular response to cocaine [GO:0071314]; cellular response to dopamine [GO:1903351]; cellular response to serotonin [GO:1904015]; negative regulation of endoplasmic reticulum calcium ion concentration [GO:0032471]; peptide cross-linking [GO:0018149]; phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway [GO:0007200]; positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]; positive regulation of cell adhesion [GO:0045785]; positive regulation of GTPase activity [GO:0043547]; positive regulation of mitochondrial calcium ion concentration [GO:0051561]; positive regulation of neurogenesis [GO:0050769]; positive regulation of small GTPase mediated signal transduction [GO:0051057]; protein deamination [GO:0018277]; protein homooligomerization [GO:0051260]; proteolysis [GO:0006508]; regulation of apoptotic cell clearance [GO:2000425]; regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0042981]; salivary gland cavitation [GO:0060662]","Q12802; PRO_0000000092 [P05067]; PRO_0000005794 [P39060]; P02751; P08727; PRO_0000018520 [P28300]; Q04206; P40337; G5E9A7; O00429-3; P50570-2; P29692-2; Q06787-7; P04792; P42858; O60333-2; D3DTS7; P60891; Q5T160; Q8N488; Q14141; O95416; Q7Z699; O14656-2; Q86WV8; P02766; Q9NYH9; O76024","SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24349085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29618516, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9575137}.
