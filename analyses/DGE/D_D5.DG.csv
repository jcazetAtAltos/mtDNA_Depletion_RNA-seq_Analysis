Acts as a metabolic regulator primarily on white adipose tissue energy expenditure as well as hepatic gluconeogenesis and cholesterol biosynthesis. In white adipocytes, regulates polyamine flux by consuming S-adenosyl-L-methionine which provides for propylamine group in polyamine biosynthesis, whereas by consuming nicotinamide controls NAD(+) levels through the salvage pathway (By similarity). Via its product N1-methylnicotinamide regulates protein acetylation in hepatocytes, by repressing the ubiquitination and increasing the stability of SIRT1 deacetylase (By similarity).
